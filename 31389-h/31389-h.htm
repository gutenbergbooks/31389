<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I.<br /><span class='h2fs'>AFLOAT ON THE WINDING AROOSTOOK.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, Bumpus Hawtree, I can do it as easy as turn my hand over,
once I get the hang of the thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you don&#8217;t say so, Giraffe? Here you&#8217;ve been trying for
these three days past, with your silly old bow and stick, twirling away like an
organ grinder; and never so much as struck a single spark of fire
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, there are a whole lot of things about the thing I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure there are. You can do everything but the right thing. You spin
that stick with the point that fits in the hole you made in that block of wood,
like fun; but your fine tinder don&#8217;t even smoke, as far as I can
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! you&#8217;ll see it do more than that, and before <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span> the end of this Maine trip,
I&#8217;ll give you to understand, Bumpus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! will I? How kind of you, Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t say that like you didn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d
ever beat it out. I&#8217;ve made fires ten different ways, and you know that.
And listen to me&#8211;I&#8217;m just bound to get one going in that South Sea
Island method we&#8217;ve read about, &#8216;or give up trying!&#8217; You hear me,
Bumpus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble about that, Giraffe. Tell you what I&#8217;ll do, though,
in the generosity of my heart&#8211;make a wager with you about that fire
business; and it&#8217;s a treat of ice-cream for the crowd, for the
loser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take you on that,&#8221; quickly snapped back the long-legged Boy
Scout who was curled up in the stern of the canvas canoe that was being pushed
along by the energetic arms of a sturdy guide, as straight as his name was the
opposite, it being Eli Crooks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s have a clear understanding,&#8221; observed the fat
lad, squatting rather awkwardly in the bow of the same craft; &#8220;say, you
other fellows, d&#8217;ye hear what we&#8217;re talking about?&#8221; and he
raised his voice a trifle, so that the occupants of the two other boats that
were close by, might listen; just as if they had not been keeping their ears
wide open; for when Bumpus and Giraffe got into a hot argument, there was
generally plenty of fun in the air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>One of the other
canoes contained three scouts, as could be told from various parts of their
khaki uniforms that they wore, even when off on a hunting trip. The clear-eyed
fellow who seemed to be in charge of the party was Thad Brewster; one of his
companions was known as Step Hen Bingham, because, as a little chap he had
insisted at school that was the way his name should be spelled, while the third
was an exceedingly wiry boy, Davy Jones by name, and who had always been a human
monkey when it came to athletics, climbing trees, and doing all sorts of queer
stunts.</p>

<p>In the third boat was a shorter Maine guide, a sort of slow chap who came by
the name of Jim Hasty just as the other did that of Crooks; and the scout with
him was Allan Hollister, a lad born in the very State they were now exploring;
and who assisted the scoutmaster in his duties.</p>

<p>All these six boys belonged to the Silver Fox Patrol connected with a troop
of scouts located in a New York town called Cranford. Two more had been unable
to take the Maine trip, which had already carried the bunch through some
adventurous times in another part of the State, whither they had first gone in
order to overtake a gentleman just then moose hunting, and with whom Thad had to
get in touch for certain business reasons.</p>

<p>Now they were on the Aroostook River, the three boats, as well as the party,
having been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
transported from Grindstone by rail, and launched at the junction of the
Masardis with the first mentioned stream.</p>

<p>One of the guides having been brought up in this region, had promised the
boys rare sport, if only they would trust to his judgment in the matter. The
trip was of indefinite length, the only stipulation being that they should not
go outside the United States, when approaching the New Brunswick border along
the great St. Johns River.</p>

<p>All of them seemed to be just bubbling over with enthusiasm and spirits. With
a new voyage before them, plenty to eat aboard the canoes, guns with which to
secure game, tents provided by Jim Hasty at his home town; and &#8220;everything
lovely, while the goose hung high,&#8221; as Bumpus had put it, really there was
no excuse for any of the scouts to feel downcast.</p>

<p>In their former trip around the Penobscot region the boys had had the good
fortune to be chiefly instrumental in causing the arrest of a couple of fleeing
yeggmen, who had broken into several banks, and for whose arrest quite a decent
reward was offered. Not only that, but they had recovered valuable bonds and
papers, that would undoubtedly cause the bank officials to back up the offer
they had made, which was to the effect that two thousand dollars would be paid
to the parties returning the said bonds, and no questions asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>Bumpus had been the
one who seemed chiefly concerned over this money matter; for it happened that
the fat scout wanted dearly to visit the Far West, and was always talking of
California, together with the game to be met with in the famous Rock Mountains.
And with this windfall coming to their almost exhausted treasure box, it now
seemed as though the Silver Fox Patrol might get away when the next vacation
came around.</p>

<p>Giraffe, the boy with the long neck, which he could twist around in a way his
comrades despaired of ever imitating, had one particular weakness. He was a
regular fire worshipper. They depended on Giraffe to start the fires, whether a
cooking blaze or the big camp-fire around which they loved to sit or lie, after
supper was over.</p>

<p>Many times did Thad have to caution him about his recklessness in this
regard; and his vigilance increased, now that they were in a State where forest
preservation was of such moment that a special fire warden, with many
assistants, was employed, to see that the laws were strictly enforced; and
intending hunters were not allowed to go forth without being accompanied by a
licensed guide, to make sure that all fires were utterly extinguished before
breaking camp.</p>

<p>Of course, when Giraffe took it upon himself to find out if he could not make
a fire after every known method, there was more or less fun for the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span> crowd. But he had proved
that his studies in this direction were worth while; for he had used flint and
steel, matches, a burning glass for the sun to do the business, and various
other methods with stunning success.</p>

<p>But he had thus far been &#8220;stumped&#8221; as he himself expressed it,
when it came to starting a blaze after the formula of the South Sea Islanders.
His little bow was made according to directions, and would whirl the pointed
stick with tremendous force in the basin that had the hole in the bottom; but
thus far, just as Bumpus so exultantly declared, the aspiring Giraffe had failed
to accomplish the object he had in view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; remarked Giraffe, &#8220;since you&#8217;ve got all
the bears and moose in the Aroostook country to listen, suppose you go and
explain what we&#8217;re driving at, Bumpus,&#8221; when the other boys had
declared that they heard the whole argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wager is cream for the crowd at the first chance,&#8221; the fat
boy went on, with pointed emphasis. &#8220;Giraffe says he can start a fire with
that bunty little bow of his, and the twirling stick that heats things up, and
makes the fine tinder take fire&#8211;when you&#8217;ve got the hang of things.
He&#8217;s got to do it before we wind up this particular trip; and at a time
when one or more of us are on deck to act as witnesses. Hear that,
fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What he says are the exact conditions,&#8221; added <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span> the confident Giraffe.
&#8220;And just make up your minds I&#8217;m going to do that same stunt yet.
Why, half a dozen times already I&#8217;ve been pretty close to getting fire;
but something always seemed to happen just at the last minute. Once my bowstring
sawed through. Another time the plaguey stick burst. Then Bumpus had to fall all
over me just when I felt sure the spark was going to come in the tinder. And the
last time, you may remember, when I sang out that I had it, why, down came that
heavy rain, and put me out of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>A general laugh followed these complaining remarks from the tall scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like you might be hoodooed, Giraffe,&#8221; said Davy Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, no matter what&#8217;s the matter, if grit and perseverance
can accomplish the business, you&#8217;ll see it done in great style sooner or
later!&#8221; cried Giraffe, who could be quite determined when he chose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s hope it will be sooner,&#8221; remarked Step Hen;
&#8220;because you know him well enough to understand that we&#8217;ll have no
peace of our lives till he either gets his little fire started, or else makes a
failure of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; broke in Allan from the rear, &#8220;no matter how it
comes out, the rest of us stand to have a free feast later on. It&#8217;s &#8216;heads
I win, tails you lose,&#8217; for the balance of the Silver Fox Patrol. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span> And in advance, we hand
our united thanks to Bumpus; or will it be Giraffe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Bumpus went on, calmly; &#8220;while Giraffe is worrying
his poor old head over that puzzle every time we get settled in camp, I&#8217;ll
be improving each shining hour like the busy little bee, trying out my new gun.
Told you fellows, I was going to invest the first chance I got; and here&#8217;s
my brand new double barrel; that&#8217;s guaranteed, the man said, to knock the
spots out of any big game that I hold it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Giraffe, who seemed a trifle grumpy on account of
having his fire-making abilities made fun of, for he was quite touchy on that
score; &#8220;chances are, it&#8217;ll knock spots out of you, first of all, or
give you a few to remember it by, if you go and get excited, and pull both
triggers at once, as you&#8217;re likely to do, if I know you at all,
Bumpus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the wide world did you go and get a big ten bore for, when
you&#8217;re such a short fellow?&#8221; asked Thad, who had often wanted to
find out about this particular subject.</p>

<p>Bumpus, who was fondling his new possession, grinned rather sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;you see, Thad&#8217;s Marlin, and
Davy&#8217;s gun are both twelve guage, and I thought we ought to have variety
in the crowd, so I got a ducking gun. Besides, I knew it would be <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span> better when I came to
shoot buckshot in it, just like I&#8217;ve got in the chambers right now, ready
for any old moose bull that chooses to show up. And in fact, fellows, it was the
only sort of shotgun I could buy, unless I took one of them pump guns; and I
just couldn&#8217;t think of working all that machinery when I get so rattled,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please keep that blunderbuss pointed the other way, Bumpus,&#8221;
said Step Hen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t you turn it around
here!&#8221; called out Giraffe. &#8220;If ever you blew a hole in the bottom of
this canvas canoe, we&#8217;d go down like a stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be sorry for that,&#8221; remarked Bumpus, still fondling
his new purchase lovingly, although he kept it pointed ahead, as directed;
&#8220;because, you see, we&#8217;ve got a lot of good grub aboard this canoe,
and it might get soaked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! thinking of the grub before you take me into consideration, are
you?&#8221; grunted Giraffe; and perhaps he might have said more, only just at
that instant Eli turned his head and made a remark to him which caused the
long-necked boy to lift his head, and then shout out excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear! A bear! over there on the bank ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! where did I put my gun?&#8221; almost shrieked Step Hen, who was
forever misplacing things, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span> then finding them again in the most unexpected
places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bumpus, knock him over! There&#8217;s the best chance to try your new
gun you ever saw! Let him have it, you silly!&#8221; roared Giraffe.</p>

<p>The fat boy heard all the clamor. He also sighted the lumbering bear, which,
after taking one good look at the approaching canoes, turned to shuffle back
again into the shelter of the protecting brush, as though he did not much fancy
any closer acquaintance with the two-legged occupants.</p>

<p>Bumpus scrambled to his knees. He was trembling like a leaf shaken in the
gale; but nevertheless managed to clumsily throw the double-barrel to his
shoulder, after pulling back both hammers.</p>

<p>They saw him bend his chubby neck, as though to sight along the barrels. Then
a tremendous explosion occurred, as though a young cannon had been fired; and
the next instant Bumpus went over flat on his back, among the duffle with which
the canoe was loaded, his feet coming into view as he landed among the blankets,
and the packages of food, secured in the rubber ponchos to keep them from
getting wet.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II.<br /><span class='h2fs'>A WARNING FROM A GAME POACHER.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Did I g-g-get him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus, as he spoke these eager words, managed to gain a sitting position,
though his first act was to rub his shoulder as though it pained him.</p>

<p>There was a roar from all the boys at this remark, and indeed, even the two
Maine guides grinned more or less.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the innocent, would you?&#8221; shouted Giraffe; &#8220;when
his buckshot tore up the water half way between the boat and the shore, till it
looked just like one of those spouting geysers we read about, out in Yellowstone
Park. Did he get him, boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>Step Hen put his hands to his mouth, megaphone fashion, and bawled out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, answer that, Mr. Bear, please; let the poor boy know whether he
tickled your tough old hide with one of his buckshot. Because, who knows,
fellows, but what it might a glanced off the top of the water, and
landed,&#8221; and he winked at Allan, who was in the canoe with Jim Hasty close
by.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t hear any answer floating back,&#8221; remarked Thad; &#8220;and so
we&#8217;ll have to believe that either the bear is lying there, stone dead, or
else has skipped out to safe quarters. Bears never can stand being fired at by
cannon, they tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannon!&#8221; burst out Giraffe at this moment, for he had managed to
possess himself of the new gun by pointing to it, and having Eli Crooks pass it
along. &#8220;Cannon! well, I should smile! What d&#8217;ye think he did,
fellers? Just exactly what I warned him to beware of, when he saw game, and got
excited; pulled both triggers at the same time! Gee! no wonder it knocked him
over! I&#8217;d hate to have been behind that charge myself; and I&#8217;ve
stood a good many heavy ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t we going ashore to see if I did just happen to bowl that
old bear over?&#8221; whined Bumpus, looking appealingly at Thad.
&#8220;I&#8217;d never forgive myself, you see, if I found out that he
<i>had</i> died, and no one even got a steak off him. A scout never wants to
waste the good things of life like that, does he, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the scoutmaster shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no chance of that happening, Bumpus,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;By now your bear is a quarter of a mile away from here, and
running yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; said Step Hen. &#8220;That new gun makes
enough noise to burst your ear drums, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_15'></a>15</span> Bumpus. And let&#8217;s hope you won&#8217;t ever
pull both triggers again. Just practice putting one finger at a time in action.
After you&#8217;ve shot the first barrel, let it just slip back to catch the
second trigger. It&#8217;s as easy as tumbling off a log.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or going over backward, when you do bang away with both barrels at
once,&#8221; added Davy Jones, wisely.</p>

<p>As they were descending the river the work was comparatively easy for the two
guides. They would have their business cut out for them later on, when their
plan of campaign, looking toward reaching the Eagle chain of lakes, was more
fully developed.</p>

<p>In the beginning there had been three of the paddlers in the party; but a
telegram had caught them as they left the train, calling the Oldtown Indian,
Sebattis, home, on account of the serious sickness of his wife.</p>

<p>Thad was capable of assuming charge of one canoe, with the assistance of Step
Hen and Davy, both lusty fellows. And so they had not bothered trying to fill
the gap at the last hour. The chances were that they might have had to take some
fellow along who would turn out to be sullen, or else a shirk; thus spoiling
much of their pleasure on the trip.</p>

<p>These members of the Silver Fox Patrol had reason to feel proud, because each
one of them was at that time wearing a trifling little badge that <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> proved their right to call
themselves assistant fire wardens, employed by the great State of Maine to
forever keep an eye out for dangerous conflagrations, and labor to extinguish
the same before they could do much damage.</p>

<p>It had come about in this manner:</p>

<p>On the train they had formed the acquaintance of a gentleman, who turned out
to be the chief fire warden, on his way right then to patrol a certain district
that nearly every year boasted of one or more severe fires.</p>

<p>He was greatly interested in Thad&#8217;s account of the numerous things a
Boy Scout aspired to do each day; and as it was his privilege to take on as many
unpaid assistants as he chose, just as a sheriff may do in an emergency, the
gentleman had with his own hands pinned a little badge on the lapel of each
boy&#8217;s coat.</p>

<p>They were very proud of the honor, and expressed their intention of serving
as fire-wardens to the best of their ability&#8211;all but Giraffe. He used to
shake his head every time he glanced down at his badge, and look solemn. The
fact of the matter was, Giraffe had all his life been so wrapped up in
<i>starting</i> fires, that the very idea of spending his precious time in
helping to <i>put one out</i> did not appeal to him very strongly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim is telling me that we can expect to see the mouth of the Little
Machias River any old time <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_17'></a>17</span> from now on,&#8221; remarked Allan; &#8220;and while
I haven&#8217;t come up this way exactly, to the Eagle waters, I guess
he&#8217;s about right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he is,&#8221; ventured Giraffe, &#8220;for we passed the place
where the Big Machias joins forces with the Aroostook some time back; and unless
my eagle eye fails me, away up ahead I can see the junction right now, where we
turn to the left, and leave this dandy old stream. Then the fun begins with the
paddles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that the fire-warden was saying to you, Thad, about some sort
of bad man up in this region, that gave the game wardens more trouble than all
the rest of the poachers combined?&#8221; Step Hen asked.</p>

<p>Jim Hasty was seen to squirm a little; and Thad noticed this as he answered
the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes, he was warning me to steer clear of one Caleb Martin, a
strapping big fellow who used to be, first a logger, and then one of those men
who get boats&#8217; knees out of the swamps and marshes up here; but who for
some years has made up his mind to loaf, and take toll of other peoples&#8217;
traps, or shoot game out of season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Martin, eh?&#8221; Step Hen went on; &#8220;seems to me it was
another name from that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Thad continued, &#8220;he did mention two others who were
said to be cronies of the big poacher. Let&#8217;s see, I believe their names
were Si <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span> Kedge and Ed
Harkness; wasn&#8217;t that it, Jim?&#8221; and he turned suddenly on the
smaller guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; answered the other, promptly; &#8220;though
to be fair and squar&#8217; with you, I didn&#8217;t hear him speakin&#8217;
o&#8217; &#8217;em atall. But I lived up hyar, yuh knows, an&#8217; Cale,
he&#8217;s been akeepin&#8217; the hull kentry kinder riled a long time now.
I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; we won&#8217;t run a crost him any, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like there wasn&#8217;t much love lost between you and this
same Cale Martin?&#8221; ventured Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;They hain&#8217;t,&#8221; was the only thing Jim would say; and Thad
knew there must be a story back of it, which he hoped later on to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should the wardens be afraid of just three men, when they have
the law on their side; that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221; Bumpus
demanded.</p>

<p>Giraffe gave a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The law don&#8217;t count for a great deal away up in the wilderness,
Bumpus,&#8221; he remarked, in a condescending way. &#8220;All sorts of things
are done when men get away off in the Maine woods. They laugh at the law, till
they feel its hand on their shoulder, and see the face of a warden close to
theirs. Then p&#8217;raps they wilt. But this bully of the big woods has had a free
hand up yonder so long, that he just thinks he&#8217;s the boss of all creation.
He needs takin&#8217; down, I reckon. And p&#8217;raps, if we happen to run across
him, it might be the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
mission of the Silver Fox Patrol to teach him a lesson. Queerer things have
happened, as we all know, looking back a little at our own
experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to brag,&#8221; remarked Thad. &#8220;Perhaps the
shoe would be on the other foot, and he might kick the lot of us out of his
territory. But all the same, let&#8217;s hope our trail won&#8217;t cross that
of Cale Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were presently turning in to the left, and starting to ascend the Little
Machias; a pretty stream, which some years back used to fairly teem with
game-fish, but which, like many another river in Maine, has felt the effect of
the continual work of thousands of fishermen, and worse than that, the sly
netting at the hands of lawless poachers.</p>

<p>Step Hen was interested in many things that opened to their view as they went
on, and his two companions did the paddling; for he had been working quite some
time himself, and was entitled to a resting spell.</p>

<p>This was a new trait in Step Hen. Time had been when he would hardly notice a
single thing when out in the woods, unless his attention was especially directed
to it by a comrade. But it was so no longer; and the way his awakening came
about, as mentioned in a previous story, is worthy of being recorded again, as
showing what a trifling thing may start a boy to thinking, and observing the
myriad of interesting events that are constantly <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span> occurring around him, no matter where he
may happen to be at the time, in a crowded city, or alone in a vast
solitude.</p>

<p>Step Hen had once come upon a humble little tumble-bug, striving to push a
ball four times as big as himself up a forlorn road, at a point where there was
a &#8220;thank-you-mum,&#8221; intended to throw the water aside during a heavy
rain, and save the road from being guttered.</p>

<p>He had grown so deeply interested in seeing the little creature try again and
again to overcome the stupendous difficulties that faced it, that he lay there
for half an hour, watching; clapping his hands when he thought success had come,
and feeling deeply sorry when a slip caused the ball to roll back again, often
upsetting the bug, and passing over its body.</p>

<p>The astonishing pluck of the humble little bug had aroused the admiration of
the boy; and in the end he had picked up both ball and bug, and placed them
safely above the baffling ascent in the road. And after that hour Step Hen awoke
to the fact that an observing boy need never lack for something intensely
interesting to chain his attention, no matter where he might be. All he had to
do was to keep his eyes open, and look. Nature had ten thousand deeply
interesting and curious things that appeal to the one who knows how to enjoy
them.</p>

<p>And so from that day Step Hen was noticed to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_21'></a>21</span> be eagerly on the watch for new sights. He asked many
questions that proved his mind had awakened; and Thad knew that that half hour
when the scout had lain alongside the mountain road down in North Carolina, had
possibly been the turning point in his career; for he would never again be the
same old careless, indifferent Step Hen of the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;There comes another canoe down the river!&#8221; suddenly cried
Bumpus, who was still squatting in the bow of the leading canoe, industriously
rubbing his right shoulder as though it pained him considerably; a fact Thad
noticed, and which had caused him to promise that he would take a look at the
lame part when they stopped for their midday meal, very soon now.</p>

<p>There was only one man in the canoe that was approaching, and presently Jim
Hasty remarked that he knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure Hen Parry, from up where I used to hold out,&#8221; he
went on to say; and then called out to the approaching Maine guide, as his
make-up pronounced the other to be; &#8220;hullo, Hen, howd&#8217;ye? Glad tuh
see yuh. Come closer, and shake hands. How&#8217;s everybody up to the old
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other dark-faced fellow seemed pleased to his old friend, and immediately
gripped the extended hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess ther putty well up thar, Jim; an&#8217; no need o&#8217; my
askin&#8217; how ye be&#8217;n, &#8217;cause yer lookin&#8217; prime,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> he remarked; and then
suddenly an expression akin to dismay flashed across his weather-beaten face, as
he continued: &#8220;By the same token I got er message fur ye, Jim, in case I
run up agin ye on my way down to Squawpan, where I gotter meet a party
that&#8217;s bound up huntin&#8217;. Ye won&#8217;t like to hear it, neither, I
kinder guess, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s from a feller ye got no use for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cale Martin?&#8221; burst involuntarily from the lips of Jim Hasty,
while his face turned a shade whiter under its coat of tan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ther same critter,&#8221; Hen went on. &#8220;He&#8217;s still
runnin&#8217; things to suit hisself up thar around the Eagle chain, an&#8217;
larfin&#8217; at all ther game wardens in Aroostook county ter stop him
ahavin&#8217; his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he tell yuh anything tuh say tuh me; an&#8217; how&#8217;d
he know I was acomin&#8217; up this aways?&#8221; asked Jim, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sez as how he heerd thet you was agoin&#8217; to bring a pack
o&#8217; boys along up to the Eagles; p&#8217;raps it kim in a letter he hed from
somebody, I don&#8217;t know jest how thet mout be; but he seemed to know it,
all right, Jim. Sez he to me, &#8216;Hen, ef ye happens to run acrost thet thar measly
little skunk what sails by the name o&#8217; Jim Hasty, jest you tell him fur me
thet if he dares to put his foot up hyar in <i>my</i> deestrick, I&#8217;m bound
to pin his ears to a tree, and leave &#8217;em thar to give him a lesson.&#8217;
An&#8217; Jim, I guess from the look he had on thet black face ob <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span> his&#8217;n when he says thet,
Cale meant it, every blessed word. And if &#8217;twas me, I&#8217;d feel like
turnin&#8217; back, to take my people another way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad fixed his eyes on Jim&#8217;s face to see how the shorter guide took it.
He realized that Jim was at least no coward, even though he might fear the wrath
of such a forest bully as the ex-logger, and present lawless poacher Cale
Martin; for he had shut his teeth hard together, and there was a grim expression
on his face, as if he did not mean to knuckle under to any such base threat as
that.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MAKER OF FIRES.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;How about that, Jim; must we turn around, and go back, just because
this feller that thinks he owns the whole north of Maine, says so?&#8221; asked
Giraffe; who was really a fearless sort of lad, and could not bear to be ordered
around by a bully.</p>

<p>Jim was looking a little &#8220;peaked,&#8221; nor could Thad blame him,
after hearing what a terror this Caleb Martin had been in the community for
years; and how even the officers of the law had never as yet dared arrest him,
even though there were rewards out for each one of the three men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, we don&#8217;t turn back, if I knows it,&#8221; said Jim,
doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Jim!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, eagerly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s eight of us, all told, in the party, and I think for my
part that it&#8217;s a pretty howd&#8217;yedo now if we can&#8217;t stand up for
our rights against just three cowards. I call them that because all bullies are,
when you come right down to it. My father says so; and I&#8217;ve seen it among
the boys in school.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;Yes,
Jim,&#8221; remarked Bumpus, with a grand air, though he immediately made a
grimace, as a quick movement gave his sore shoulder a wrench; &#8220;we&#8217;re
going to stand by you, through thick and thin, ain&#8217;t we,
fellers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight guns in the crowd!&#8221; remarked Davy Jones with an air of
confidence. &#8220;Sure we ought to hold the fort, and then some, if deadly
weapons count for anything up here, and I&#8217;m told they do. P&#8217;raps, instead
of pinning your ears to a tree, Jim, this same Mister Cale&#8217;ll consent to
walk back with us, and give himself up to a game warden of the great and
glorious State of Maine. We mustn&#8217;t forget that we&#8217;re all sworn-in
officers of the said State, and bound to assist any game warden who is trying to
do his duty, and earn his salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the other guide said good-bye, and turning his canoe down-stream,
shot away with the current; while the scouts headed up further toward the
wilderness that lay around the country of the Eagle chain of lakes, close to the
northern border of the State.</p>

<p>They landed presently to have a bite at noon. Thad took advantage of the
opportunity to look at Bumpus&#8217; shoulder. As he anticipated, he found that
there was quite an ugly black-and-blue bruise there, which would cause the boy
considerable pain for several days; though he declared that nothing was going to
keep him from practicing with his new <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_26'></a>26</span> gun, which seemed like a toy in the hands of a
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you could not have held the butt close against your
shoulder when you fired,&#8221; Thad ventured, as his opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what,&#8221; admitted the other, with a sigh.
&#8220;Know better next time, though, Thad; and thank you for making it feel
easier. But I wish I&#8217;d got that bear. How fine it would be to eat steak
from a big bear I&#8217;d killed with the first shot from my new gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make that plural, Bumpus, for you fired <i>both</i> barrels,
remember,&#8221; laughed Thad.</p>

<p>They were soon on the move again, and pushing steadily up against the current
of the Little Machias. An hour or two passed. The air was not nipping cold at
this time of the day; but as the season was now considerably advanced they
expected to meet with considerable frost, and even some ice, before coming back
once more to the home town.</p>

<p>Lest the reader who has not made the acquaintance of the Boy Scouts in the
previous volume, should think it strange that these six lads were able to be
away from their school duties for such a length of time at this season of the
year, it may be best to enter a little explanation right here.</p>

<p>An unfortunate epidemic of contagious sickness had broken out in Cranford,
and as a number of the scholars of the school were affected, the trustees <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span> had reluctantly decided
that the session between early Fall and New Years must be abandoned. If all were
well at the later date, after the usual holidays, school would be resumed. But
the health of the community demanded that the boys and girls be separated for
the time being.</p>

<p>Just then Thad&#8217;s guardian, a genial old man who was known far and wide
as &#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Brewster, found that he had urgent need of communicating
with a gentleman by the name of Carson, who had recently gone up into Maine on
his annual moose hunt in the big game country. As he might not come out before
January, and the necessity of giving him certain documents was great, Thad had
been asked to make the trip.</p>

<p>They had long been counting on a chance to visit the home country of their
Maine fellow scout, Allan Hollister; and most of the scouts eagerly seized on
this opportunity to carry out the project, though two of the patrol were unable
to be along.</p>

<p>And so they were now in a condition to thoroughly enjoy the outing, since
Thad had carried out his mission, and given the papers into the keeping of Mr.
Carson; receiving a message in return which he had wired to the old gentleman
when in touch with a telegraph station.</p>

<p>Thad himself had believed that there was not the slightest cloud along the
horizon; and now that this <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_28'></a>28</span> Cale Martin business had cropped up, he began to
realize that after all it might not be such clear sailing as they had figured
on.</p>

<p>Still, Thad was not the one to borrow trouble, though ready to grapple with
it in any shape or manner, once it found them out.</p>

<p>They camped early on that night, because all of them were a little tired; and
the location on the shore looked especially fine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, look at what Giraffe&#8217;s going to do!&#8221; exclaimed
Bumpus, after they had carried part of their things ashore, and were busily
engaged in putting up the two big tents supplied by Jim Hasty from his camp
stores, such as all Maine guides delight to possess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, ain&#8217;t it a part of my business to start the fire every
time?&#8221; demanded the party in question, who was on his knees;
&#8220;didn&#8217;t Thad promise me that job if I&#8217;d keep on being careful
about startin&#8217; fires every-which-way? I ain&#8217;t had a blessed match on
my person since I gave that promise, have I, Thad? And what&#8217;s wrong about
my getting the blaze in my own way, tell me that, Bumpus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we want supper, and we don&#8217;t mean to sit around here an hour
or two, just watchin&#8217; you tinker with that silly old bow and stick,
twirling away like you had to saw through to China. How about that, Thad?&#8221;
and Bumpus turned <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
appealingly toward the patrol leader, well knowing that whatever he said would
go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bumpus is right, Giraffe,&#8221; the other said, kindly but firmly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to spend all the time you want with that
contraption, after you&#8217;ve started our cooking fire; but it wouldn&#8217;t
be fair to hold up the whole bunch just to please yourself. Your own good sense
tells you that, Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giraffe, of course, had to appear to be convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when I had a new scheme in my head, too, that I just know would
have made the fire come,&#8221; he grumbled, as he hung the little bow on a twig
of a tree near by, and produced flint and steel, and a little bag in which he
kept tinder, in the shape of tiny shavings which he was always preparing at odd
moments; &#8220;and before I get another chance to try it, I&#8217;ll have
forgotten the combination, sure. But that&#8217;s always the way it goes; though
don&#8217;t you dare think Bumpus Hawtree, that I&#8217;m going to give up so
easy. I&#8217;ll fight it out this way if it takes all winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being an adept with the flint and steel, Giraffe quickly had his fire
started.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;ll be after I&#8217;ve just got that
one little snag passed,&#8221; he took occasion to remark, for the benefit of
the fat scout, who was hovering near by. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s easy as
tumbling off a log, once you know how. P&#8217;raps you remember what a time you had
learnin&#8217; to ride a bike; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_30'></a>30</span> and yet now you can cut around corners, and even
stand on the saddle while she&#8217;s going. Well, you wait and see my
smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! that&#8217;s all I ever will see, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
chuckled Bumpus.</p>

<p>But presently Giraffe managed to drift into a more amiable humor. That was
when the coffee pot was bubbling on the fire, sending out its cheery aroma; and
the last of the eggs they had managed to buy from a potato grower on the bank of
the Aroostook were sizzling in the two large frying-pans.</p>

<p>Most boys possess hearty appetites, and Giraffe was no exception to the rule.
Indeed, like most lean fellows, he had an enormous stowage capacity somewhere
about him, and could dispose of more food on occasion than any two of his mates.
Bumpus always declared he had hollow legs, and used them for receptacles, when
other places were filled to overflowing. But not one of the scouts could
remember the time when Giraffe complained of having eaten too much. Like the
crowded street car, there was always room for more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish we&#8217;d struck this section of country an hour or two before
dark,&#8221; Bumpus ventured to remark, complacently, as he sat there with his
fat legs doubled under him, tailor-fashion and munching at the crackers and
cheese he had made a sandwich out of.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>&#8220;For
why?&#8221; asked Giraffe, looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! a feller might have just taken a little turn around here, and
knocked over a deer, or something of the sort,&#8221; Bumpus replied, with the
utmost assurance in the world; just as though such a thing were of common
occurrence in his life. &#8220;Looks right gamey around here; how&#8217;s that,
Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Jim Hasty told us that much!&#8221; declared Step Hen, before the
scoutmaster could find a chance to say anything. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear
him tell how every season there&#8217;s been a moose or two killed within ten
miles of where we&#8217;ve got our camp right now. But we can&#8217;t hold up
yet to do any hunting; so you&#8217;ll just have to put a crimp in that sporting
spirit you&#8217;ve developed so suddenly, Bumpus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to him talk, would you?&#8221; exclaimed Giraffe; &#8220;and
only a little while back you couldn&#8217;t get Bumpus to even touch a gun. Say,
you&#8217;re a marvel, all right, Bumpus. They&#8217;ll have you set up as the
eighth wonder of the world soon, ahead of the telephone, wireless, moving
pictures, and even the talking machine. Edison and all the rest of those old
wizards had better take a back seat when you come around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joking and chatting, they made the time pass very happily. If Jim Hasty were
in reality much concerned over the prospect of his meeting with the ugly poacher
who had a bone to pick with him, he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_32'></a>32</span> at least did not show it outwardly any longer. But
then Jim was a man of few words as a rule; and it was hardly to be expected that
so hardy a fellow would tremble, just at the mention of a name.</p>

<p>There was room for them all under the shelter of the tents, though as a rule,
so long as the weather kept on being fairly pleasant, the two hardy guides
declared that they much preferred to wrap up in their blankets and sleep under
the stars. Such men become used to what would seem hardships to the city bred
person, and in truth think very little of enduring them. And it was by no means
cold enough as yet, to drive them into taking shelter under the canvas.</p>

<p>Giraffe had been working away at his fire-making business pretty much all of
the evening, and Bumpus had watched him for a while; but growing tired of seeing
the other sawing away as if for dear life, he had finally laughed, and turned
away.</p>

<p>If Giraffe came near making things &#8220;go&#8221; that evening, at least
once more the glory of a full success slipped away from his eager hands,
outstretched to clutch it; for when it came time for them to &#8220;shut up
shop,&#8221; as Thad said, and crawl into the two tents, he had not brought
about his expected blaze, though his face looked more determined than ever.</p>

<p>Bumpus, Giraffe and Allan occupied one tent; while the other three scouts
were assigned to the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
second. The guides promised to share their shelter only in case of a storm, or
very severe weather.</p>

<p>The fire was allowed to die down. If any strong wind came up in the night it
would be the duty of the guides to see that burning brands were not carried into
the adjacent woods, to set fire to the brown pine needles that covered the
ground; and were so full of resinous matter that once ignited they would send a
wall of flame down the wind that would do incalculable damage.</p>

<p>Soon quiet rested over the camp. The frosty night breeze sighed among the
branches overhead; the owl hooted to its mate deep in the wood; and the hour of
midnight, when Thad peeped forth, (and which he knew to have arrived from the
position of certain stars overhead), saw the last of the fire vanishing in dead
embers.</p>

<p>Thad sought the warmth of his blanket again in a hurry, for the air was now
nipping cold, especially after the snug nest had been temporarily abandoned. And
he must have gone right to sleep, for he did not seem to remember anything after
again creeping under the double folds of the warm woolen covering.</p>

<p>Now, when one sleeps like most boys do, soundly, it is impossible to figure
how time passes when awakened in a hurry. So that Thad could not tell what the
hour might be when he found himself starting up hurriedly, under the conviction
that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span> strange as it
might seem at that season of the year, and with the air frosty, there was a
storm bearing down upon them, for he thought it was thunder he heard.</p>

<p>Then came a tremendous crash, and the tent swayed, but did not fall; though
from the wild shouts that arose close at hand the young patrol leader reckoned
the same good fortune could not have befallen the other shelter, because he
could plainly catch the howls of Step Hen, Bumpus and Giraffe.</p>

<p>Quick as thought Thad whirled over to the exit, and crawled out. And what his
eyes beheld was enough to startle anybody, let alone a boy. If a genuine cyclone
had not struck the camp on the Little Machias, then something almost as bad must
have dropped down upon them, Thad thought, as he stared, hardly able to believe
his eyes, or understand what it all meant.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>A TERROR THAT CAME IN THE NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>Why, the second tent had utterly left the place where Thad remembered they
had erected it. He had just a fleeting glimpse of something dingy white
careering along over the ground among the trees, and then it vanished.</p>

<p>But there was a high time going on near by, where the contents of the
interior of the late tent were scattered around. Blankets heaved, and legs were
thrust out, while the owners of the same were screaming at the top of their
voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what is this?&#8221; bellowed Bumpus, who seemed to be almost
smothered under the folds of his blanket, which he must have had up over his
head at the time the catastrophe came upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hurricane, that&#8217;s what, and our bally old tent has
been carried away!&#8221; shouted Giraffe. &#8220;Hang on to anything you can
grab, fellers, or you may be taken next! Whoop! let her come! I&#8217;ve got
hold of a tree now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much you have,&#8221; remarked Thad, &#8220;that&#8217;s my leg
you&#8217;re hanging on to. Let go, and we&#8217;ll soon find out what
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t
it a storm after all then?&#8221; demanded Step Hen, as he came creeping out
under the canvas of the back of the one tent that had been left standing, with
most of his clothes hugged tightly in his grip, as though he did not mean to be
utterly left without something to keep him warm, if the worst had befallen
them.</p>

<p>Thad had by now gleaned an inkling of the truth. And it was so utterly
ridiculous that he felt as though he must soon burst into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;First tell me if anybody was hurt?&#8221; he demanded, feeling that it
would be wrong to show any merriment if such should prove to be the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; remarked Giraffe; &#8220;seemed to me
something heavy came squash down on top of me like a thousand of bricks. Mebbe
it was only the tent pole falling. Guess I ain&#8217;t hurt much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Allan?&#8221; asked Thad, hardly thinking it worth
while to ask Bumpus, who seemed to be all right; though he was already beginning
to dance around, as the nipping fingers of Jack Frost got busy with his thinly
covered shanks, about which he had only his flimsy pajamas over his
underclothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never happened to step on me, though he came within three inches of my
back!&#8221; replied the Maine boy; and there was something about his words to
tell that Allan must already have guessed what had been the cause for all this
commotion, and the stealing of their tent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>Bumpus caught at
the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all that?&#8221; he demanded quickly; &#8220;was it the
work of some mean feller, after all? Hey, is that the way your old Cale Martin
gets in his work, sneakin&#8217; up in the dead of night, when we&#8217;re all
sleepin&#8217; as innocent as the babes in the woods, and snatchin&#8217; off
our covers before you could wink an eye, or say Jack Robinson? Well, I like his
nerve, that&#8217;s what; and he&#8217;d better look out how he keeps on
tryin&#8217; tricks on travelers. Say, he switched our tent, too!&#8221; and
Bumpus gave a whistle, as well as his trembling lips would allow, to emphasize
his disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can thank your lucky stars old fellow,&#8221; said Allan,
&#8220;that he didn&#8217;t plant one of his hoofs square on your
stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoofs!&#8221; echoed Bumpus, aghast; &#8220;say, then it wasn&#8217;t
that old poacher after all, was it? Hoofs? That must mean it was an animal.
Looky here, somebody get the fire started again, so we won&#8217;t shake to
pieces while we&#8217;re hunting our clothes, and listening to the explanation
of this latest outrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! let Davy do it,&#8221; said Giraffe; &#8220;I&#8217;m nearly
frozen stiff myself right now; and besides,&#8221; he added as a brilliant
after-thought, &#8220;you know I don&#8217;t carry matches with me any more. And
of course you wouldn&#8217;t want to wait while I swung my little
bow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my left shoe?&#8221; shouted Step
Hen just then; for there never was a time when he could find <i>all</i> his
belongings; and in a case of excitement like this it was a certainty that his
customary complaint would soon be heard in the land. &#8220;Who&#8217;s gone and
took my left shoe? I&#8217;m dead certain I had both of &#8217;em when I started
to crawl under the canvas. Somebody thinks it smart to keep playin&#8217; jokes
on <i>me</i> all the time. Why can&#8217;t they let <i>my</i> things be,
Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that sticking out of the pocket of your coat?&#8221;
asked Allan, as Davy managed to strike a match, and apply the fire to the only
lantern they carried with them on the trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, whoever stuck that in there?&#8221; Step Hen went on,
unblushingly. &#8220;Thinks it smart to do such silly things, and have me
guessing all the time. Just switch off, and try it on one of the others,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Knowing that he must have undoubtedly placed the shoe in that pocket himself
in the haste of his departure from the tent that remained, Step Hen did not dare
accuse any one in particular; but glared around at vacancy when thus addressing
his supposed-to-be enemy.</p>

<p>But they were so accustomed to his failings by now that no one paid much
attention to what he was saying. In fact, it would have been a cause for
astonishment if twenty-four hours ever slipped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_39'></a>39</span> past without an outburst from Step Hen in connection
with some of his personal belongings, that seemed to have taken wings in the
most mysterious fashion, and vanished, although they always turned up again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what sort of an animal was it, Thad?&#8221; asked Bumpus, still
dancing about, and slapping himself in every conceivable place in order to keep
his blood in circulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Jim, or Eli,&#8221; replied the patrol leader, who was really too
busy just then getting some of his own clothes, to bother answering.</p>

<p>So the others turned to the two guides, who, not having removed any of their
ordinary garments, did not feel the chilly night air as much as the lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it banged us over, Eli?&#8221; asked Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moose bull on the rampage!&#8221; replied the Maine woodsman, readily
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great big moose like that one we shot a while ago!&#8221; echoed
Bumpus, showing great excitement. &#8220;Just my luck. Why, if he&#8217;d heard
that I had a new gun, and was waiting to see what it could do, he couldn&#8217;t
have been kinder. Just knocked at our door; and when nobody answered him he went
away again, and by jinks! carried the door and the rest of the house with him.
However in the wide world do you suppose that happened, Eli? <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> I guess you ought to know,
because you&#8217;re acquainted with the queer ways of these woods&#8217;
critters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never knew such a thing before in all my experience in woods,&#8221;
asserted the older guide, shaking his head. &#8220;Fire was out, wind blowing
wrong way for moose to smell human critters; and he must a thought he heard
&#8217;nother bull on the edge o&#8217; ther water, wantin&#8217; to fight him. Anyhow
he jest natchrally tore right through that tent. It got fast to his horns, and
he&#8217;s been an&#8217; kerried it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what tough luck. If I&#8217;d only been on the watch I&#8217;d
have the honor of shooting the first moose that took to wearin&#8217; clothes
human way,&#8221; groaned Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye suppose, then, he&#8217;s keepin&#8217; our bally tent; and
won&#8217;t we ever set eyes on the same again?&#8221; asked Giraffe, holding
his chilled hands out toward the fire that in Davy&#8217;s charge had been
revived again until it sent out a genial warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon know,&#8221; remarked Jim, who had a personal interest in the
matter, seeing that the purloined canvas belonged to him; though of course he
knew that his employers would stand for any loss he incurred while working in
their service.</p>

<p>He took the lantern, and started away. Thad had managed to get some of his
clothes on by this time, and he hurried after the shorter guide, who seemed to
know exactly in which direction to pursue his investigations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>&#8220;I can see
something ahead there,&#8221; Thad remarked, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the tent, all right,&#8221; remarked Jim. &#8220;I only
hopes as how she ain&#8217;t too bad cut up now. &#8217;Twas nearly new, and good, and
stout; so I guess the ole chap he had some trouble gettin&#8217; loose from the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the tent where it had caught on a sprout, and torn free from the
branching antlers of the moose, commonly called his horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad after all,&#8221; remarked Jim, when he had examined the
extent of the damage made by the tent&#8217;s being so forcibly carried off.
&#8220;I kin patch it up easy, when I gits a chance in the boat, to-morry. Guess
as haow we gut off right smart, all things considerin&#8217;, Thad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the young scoutmaster was ready to echo these words, when he got to
thinking how one of a dozen things might have accompanied the mad rush of the
moose through the camp.</p>

<p>They never did know what had really caused his charge; whether some
vindictive spirit of rage provoked the huge beast; or that he fancied a rival
bull were challenging him to mortal combat, just as in the case of the fellow,
whom Sebattis had previously lured within gunshot, with his seductive moose
call.</p>

<p>The balance of the night gave them only broken sleep; because of the sudden
and rude shock of this awakening. Bumpus hugged his new gun close to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span> his side; and raised his
head so often to listen, that both Giraffe and Allan vowed they would be
compelled to chase him outside if he didn&#8217;t get busy, and capture some
sleep right away.</p>

<p>Morning came in due time, and they found that little damage had been done by
the rush of the moose, beyond some rents in the canvas of the tent.</p>

<p>Once more they started forth, and all that day plodded on, making many miles,
and by evening reaching the spot where Jim said they could have their canoes and
luggage carried over to Portage Lake by a man he knew, who owned a team and a
wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it across from here?&#8221; asked Thad, seeking
information.</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends on what way yuh go thar,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;but I
guesses as Nick he likes the three mile carry best. Start fresh in the
mornin&#8217; sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had partaken of an early supper Jim went off to find his friend
who owned the team, while the others busied themselves getting their belongings
in as small a compass as possible, looking forward to what was expected to
happen on the following morning.</p>

<p>Later, when Jim came back, he reported that he had interviewed Nick, and made
all necessary arrangements with him to take the three canoes, and the stuff that
went with them, across the carry in the morning. The boys were expected to walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span> and if necessary
push at the wheels of the wagon, should it get stuck in a creek bed of soft
quicksand.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly, and all hands managed to put in plenty of time
sleeping, to make up for the loss of the previous one. In the morning the loud
&#8220;whoa&#8221; of a stentorian voice announced the arrival of the expected
team. They proved to be oxen instead of horses, and once the canoes, and other
stuff, had been loaded on the big low wagon, the journey commenced.</p>

<p>Slow progress was the order of the day. Giraffe grumbled, but it did no good.
And it was really noon when they finally came in sight of the lake.</p>

<p>The canoes were gladly launched, a light lunch eaten, the teamster paid off,
and then again the voyage was resumed under a favoring sky; for the air was
bracing, and so far not a sign of the first snow storm had made its appearance,
though the guides warned their charges to be prepared for the worst, as a
downfall was nearly due.</p>

<p>A cold wind was blowing from the northwest so that the wise guides hugged the
sheltered shore of Portage Lake, since the waves were of pretty good size, and
the flying spray would be far from pleasant in such weather.</p>

<p>Finally they reached the place where the lake had its outlet into a small
stream, that, after flowing for a number of miles, emptied into the Lower Lake
of the great and famous Eagle chain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>On the shore of
this lake then, they made their next camp. From the grave manner of Jim, the
scoutmaster easily guessed that they must by now have entered the territory
where Cale Martin, the slippery old poacher, held forth. Jim seemed to look
about him more than before. He also started at the least unusual sound, showing
that while he might try to disguise the fact, he was really nervous. Still, he
did not give the slightest indication of showing the white feather, or backing
down, before a dozen like Cale Martin.</p>

<p>Davy had purchased a little snapshot camera at the town below, and also some
flashlight cartridges with which he wished to get some views of the group around
the camp-fire at night. No one had made any effort to perpetuate such scenes
which Davy declared were the very best part of the whole trip. And now that they
had become fairly launched upon the journey he was aching to start into business
with his new outfit.</p>

<p>Davy knew a little about taking pictures, although far from being an expert.
He had never used flashlight powders, or cartridges before; and after reading
all the directions carefully, he declared he felt prepared to take a picture
that would be viewed with the greatest satisfaction in the world by all his
chums, when this great Maine vacation were only a memory of the past.</p>

<p>So Davy warned his campmates not to be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_45'></a>45</span> alarmed if there suddenly flashed upon them a great
light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get you all in characteristic attitudes, if I
could&#8211;that was the way the feller who sold me the camera called it; and he
said the best pictures were the natural ones. What I mean is, that if I could
grab Step Hen here, for instance, with that silly look of his on his face,
saying: &#8216;Anybody seen my camp hatchet around? Funny how it&#8217;s always
<i>my</i> things that get carried off! The jinx never hides anything belonging
to <i>you</i> fellers!&#8217; I&#8217;d have something worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! come off, will you, Davy; if I thought I looked like you say,
I&#8217;d let all my traps disappear every day but what I&#8217;d kick up a
row,&#8221; and Step Hen assumed an air of indignation with these words that
caused a general laugh to go around.</p>

<p>Of course it had to be explained to the two guides, for they were to be in
the picture, smoking their pipes contentedly; and apparently Eli telling a
story, to which the rest of the scouts were listening eagerly, possibly
laughing.</p>

<p>Having fixed things to his satisfaction, Davy disappeared, slipping away from
the camp-fire on the side he had decided upon as offering the best natural
advantages for a flashlight view.</p>

<p>They could not see him, but guessed that he was working his way toward them
as slily as he could; since he had announced that he meant to play the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> part of an enemy, stealing
up to spy upon the camp.</p>

<p>Presently they did manage to get Eli started telling a story; for Thad knew
it would be better for the picture if the guides seemed natural, and not on
parade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Davy was creeping forward, intent on reaching the place he had
picked out beforehand, and where, without exposing himself, he could set his
camera, and then fire the cartridge.</p>

<p>When to his uneducated mind&#8211;in the line of photography&#8211;Davy had
things just about to his liking, he held himself in readiness for what he deemed
an extra fine view, when the boys were laughing heartily at the climax of
Eli&#8217;s queer story of a scrape he once found himself in that was really
humorous, though at the time it may have appeared anything but that to the
actor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; said Davy, partly to himself, as he fired his
cartridge.</p>

<p>There was a sudden brilliant and dazzling flash, that must have been as
fierce as the display of lightning when the bolt hits close at hand. And while
those at the fire were schooled to repress their natural alarm, evidently the
same could not be said of a looker-on not counted in the bill; for there was a
hoarse cry of alarm from the bushes across the way, and the sound of crashing
seemed to tell of a precipitate flight.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><span class='h2fs'>JIM&#8217;S SECRET.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; exclaimed Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Davy just had to let out a whoop!&#8221; commented Step Hen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think again, would you,&#8221; spoke up Giraffe, who sat there
twisting his long neck this way and that, in a comical way, as though seeking to
discover the object of the strange outcry; &#8220;it came from the other side of
the camp from where Davy is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the indifferent Step Hen, as if not wanting to be
bothered, &#8220;then it must have been some animal that was curious enough to
prowl around our camp, and got a good scare, free, gratis, for
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was no animal that made that sound, and I leave it to Thad or Allan
here,&#8221; Bumpus insisted.</p>

<p>Indeed, even the sleepy Step Hen sat up and took notice that the two
mentioned, as well as Jim and Eli, were already on their feet, exchanging
significant looks. Words were hardly needed to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_48'></a>48</span> proclaim that they deemed the circumstance as one
worthy of investigation.</p>

<p>Just then Davy came in, bearing his little camera, and with a grin on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a fine picture that time, I reckon, fellers,&#8221; he announced,
after the manner of satisfied camera fiends the world over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you give a shout, Davy?&#8221; asked Thad, thinking it best to
settle that point in the start, before going any further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I know of, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; immediately replied the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear one?&#8221; continued the patrol leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I did, and took it for granted that Step Hen or Giraffe had been
scared by the fireworks display, in spite of my warning, and squealed,&#8221;
Davy replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it, then,&#8221; Thad went on, turning to Eli and Jim;
&#8220;get a torch, or the lantern, and we&#8217;ll see what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! this looks some interesting!&#8221; exclaimed Giraffe, beginning
to show signs of excitement himself.</p>

<p>Eli picked up the lantern, and lighted it. Then he led the way into the
bushes at the exact spot where, according to his educated ear, the snort and the
crash had come from.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep back, the rest of you,&#8221; said Thad, &#8220;and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span> let Eli do the looking. If
he finds anything worth while, be sure you&#8217;ll all know about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later the old guide called to them to come on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for Eli; he&#8217;s lost no time in making good!&#8221;
exclaimed Giraffe.</p>

<p>The whole party crowded around the old guide, who was on his knees on the
ground, apparently examining some tracks he had found. He waved a hand to keep
them from crowding too close to him, so as to interfere with his work.</p>

<p>Bending low, Thad could easily see the marks. Some one had been crouching
there in the bushes, and spying on the camp. That he could not be an honest
woodsman it was easy to guess, for as such he would have stalked straight into
camp, sure of the warm welcome that is always extended to a stranger who looks
good.</p>

<p>Eli pointed to the impression close to the footprints.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s whar he rested the butt o&#8217; his rifle,&#8221; he
said, positively, and Thad knew it was exactly as Eli declared, just as though
he could himself see the actions of the hidden man. &#8220;Got on his knees and
crawled up to whar he c&#8217;ud poke his nose outen the scrub hyar, an&#8217; watch
us. And hyar&#8217;s whar he was arestin&#8217; on jest wun knee; cause ye kin
see the mark o&#8217; his foot beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he doing that for?&#8221; asked Thad, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span> though deep down in his heart he seemed
to instinctively know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I kinder guess naow thet he mout a be&#8217;n a tryin&#8217; to see
how he cud kiver wun o&#8217; us with his <i>gun!</i>&#8221; replied Eli.</p>

<p>He beckoned to Jim, and that worthy approached. There was a troubled look on
the face of the younger guide that Thad could not but notice; and he realized
that the affair might not be so great a mystery to Jim as it seemed to the rest
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a squint at them hood tracks hyar, Jim; p&#8217;raps ye mout sorter
reckernize the same,&#8221; Eli remarked drily.</p>

<p>Jim only needed that one glance, and then he gritted his teeth as he
observed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! twar <i>him</i>, all right, Eli; I knowed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! and again I say, wow! this here is sure getting mighty
interesting!&#8221; muttered Giraffe, shuffling uneasily from one foot to the
other; while Bumpus, filled with a sudden alarm, started back into the camp, to
arm himself with his new gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Old Cale Martin?&#8221; demanded Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;None other,&#8221; answered Jim, moodily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he must have seen you, Jim, sitting here?&#8221; the patrol
leader went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shore did,&#8221; replied the short guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;And amused himself covering you with his gun, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> just as if to say that he could put a
bullet in you, if so be he wanted; but he didn&#8217;t want to, did he Jim?</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon he didn&#8217;t, sir,&#8221; the other ventured. &#8220;Yuh
see, he ain&#8217;t jest <i>thet</i> mad at me, so&#8217;s tuh wanter kill me;
jest sez as haow I gotter keep away from whar he camps, yuh know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sill, he said he meant to pin your ears to a tree, if he caught you up
here; those were about the words your guide friend, Hen Parry, used,
weren&#8217;t they, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s what they was; an&#8217; he meant it, too,&#8221; Jim
replied. &#8220;Thet&#8217;s one o&#8217; his good points, thet he allers keeps
his word. If them game wardens cud ever git Ole Dad Martin tuh say as he never
wud kill game outen season agin, they&#8217;d know nawthin&#8217; under the
sun&#8217;d tempt him tuh do hit, not even if he was a dyin&#8217; fuh a bite
o&#8217; meat. He ain&#8217;t all bad, this here Cale Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about you, Jim; seems to me this is taking big chances in
your coming up here, when such a lawless character has a grudge against you, and
is waiting to put his stamp on you that way. And strikes me, Jim, that you must
have had a motive in coming, that was more than just bluff. How about
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young guide glanced at Thad when he said this, and evidently realized
that the patrol leader could read his mind better than most people; he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> looked a little confused;
then gave a short nervous laugh, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, naow, sense yuh sized me up thet away, I&#8217;ll jest hev tuh
admit thet I did hev a notion in comin&#8217; up here, &#8216;sides takin&#8217; ye
through the Eagle Lakes. I hed my orders tuh come, an&#8217; from one as I hes
tuh mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away while speaking, as though not inclined to say more just then
in the presence of so many; but Thad made up his mind there was a story back of
the strange actions of Jim; and that a few point-blank questions might bring it
out. Before he slept he hoped he would find a chance to get Jim to one side and
ask him about it; for he had reason to believe the other was ready to confide in
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;ll come back again to-night?&#8221; asked Davy
Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221; remarked a voice at the elbow of the speaker; and
turning, they beheld Bumpus flourishing his new double-barrel gun, as though
only too anxious for a chance to hold somebody up at its muzzle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you keep that cannon aimed the other way, if you please!&#8221;
cried Giraffe, dodging behind a convenient tree. &#8220;You ought to be marked
with a red flag &#8216;dangerous&#8211;dynamite!&#8217; that&#8217;s what I
think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s get back to camp,&#8221; remarked Thad. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span> &#8220;There&#8217;s
little chance of Old Cale coming back here to-night. He got the scare of his
life when that flashlight burst on him so sudden like. I wouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if he thought a rapid-fire machine gun was opening on him; or else
that lightning had taken to camping on his trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; remarked Allan, &#8220;he just couldn&#8217;t help
turning and running as if the Old Nick were after him. And from that we can
guess that Cale never heard tell of flashlight pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, can you blame him?&#8221; asked Thad. &#8220;Makes me think of
the old fable, when the lion and the donkey went hunting together. The lion took
up his station at the mouth of the cave where some goats had hidden, while the
donkey went in; and made all sorts of terrible noises, braying. So the goats ran
out, and the lion killed as many as he wanted. When the donkey came out he asked
his partner if he had done the job in good shape. &#8216;Fine,&#8217; said the lion,
&#8216;and you would have frightened me too, if I hadn&#8217;t known that you were
only a donkey.&#8217; And that&#8217;s the way with us, fellows; we were on to
the game in advance, or some of us might have taken to our heels too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, that sounds mighty much like you were calling me a
donkey,&#8221; remarked Davy, trying to display a certain amount of offended
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! not in the least,&#8221; laughed Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the shoe fits, put it on,&#8221; jeered Giraffe. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span> &#8220;You know they say
that wherever you see smoke, there&#8217;s sure to be fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much there ain&#8217;t,&#8221; burst out Bumpus, with a grin.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen <i>heaps</i> of smoke started, without a sign of a
blaze,&#8221; and Giraffe subsided into silence knowing what was meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get a good picture, Davy?&#8221; asked Thad, as they once more
settled down around the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seemed like it to me,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;It was just when
you were all laughing at what Eli here was saying. He had his hand up, like he
was going to smack it down in the palm of the other, to emphasize a telling
point in his story. Say, wouldn&#8217;t it be a great stunt now, if, when I
developed that plate, I found a face sticking out of the bushes across yonder;
and Jim here recognized it as belonging to that big terror of the pine woods,
Cale Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that would be just great!&#8221; ejaculated Step Hen; and all
eyes were turned toward Jim; but that worthy made no remark, though he must have
surely heard what was said.</p>

<p>As the evening grew on apace Thad was watching for the chance he wanted, to
get a few words in private with the younger guide. Jim somehow had interested
Thad from the start. He never said anything about himself or his folks; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> somehow the young
patrol leader had been drawn toward Jim. He believed the fellow to be a sturdy
chap, clean and honest as any guide ever employed by big game hunters in the
Maine woods. And now that it began to appear that there was a little mystery
attached to his past, of course Thad felt a deeper interest in Jim than
ever.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was accident that took Jim off after a while; he may have just
wanted to smoke his pipe alone, and ponder on the strange fate that seemed to
throw him once more in contact with the man who had crossed his life trail in
the past, and apparently not in a pleasant way either. But somehow Thad
conceived an idea that Jim just knew he wanted to have a quiet little chat with
him; and was thus making an opening.</p>

<p>Just as he had expected he found the guide leaning against a tree near by.
The light from the flickering blaze of the camp-fire reached the spot, but
faintly; and Jim did not even show any signs of nervousness when Thad drew near,
which was one indication that he had half expected his coming.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jim even invited a chance to bestow his confidence on the young
scoutmaster. He must have seen before now that Thad Brewster was no ordinary
boy; and when a man has been brooding over <i>something</i> a long time, he
often feels like having a friend to whom he may pour out the troubles <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span> of his soul, and from whom
perhaps he may look for advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not thinking of changing your mind, are you Jim?&#8221; asked Thad, as
he joined the other by the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;If yuh mean &#8217;bout goin&#8217; back, an&#8217; feelin&#8217; like
a whipped houn&#8217; dog, sir, &#8217;taint in Jim Hasty tuh do thet aways.
Fact is,&#8221; the guide went on, with a stubborn ring in his voice,
&#8220;meetin&#8217; up with Ole Cale jest kinder makes me more sot in my mind
than ever. I stays with yuh right through, yuh kin bank on thet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I only hope he&#8217;ll conclude to give us a wide berth, and
make up his mind that he&#8217;d better keep his hands off,&#8221; Thad went on.
&#8220;Seems like he doesn&#8217;t fancy you any too much, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a plain invitation, and the other so regarded it, for he immediately
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I kinder guess Ole Cale does hate me wuss nor pizen, sir. P&#8217;raps
he&#8217;s gut reason fut hit; an&#8217; agin, mebbe he hain&#8217;t. &#8216;Tall
depends on the way yuh look at hit. I on&#8217;y done what any man o&#8217;
speerit&#8217;d adone, if so be he found himself up agin a stone wall like Cale
Martin&#8217;s &#8216;no, not on yuh life!&#8217; meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you asked him for something, did you, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest what I done, sir; which something war what he happened to keer
more fur than anything <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> else on the yarth,&#8221; Jim replied; and Thad could
detect something soft and tender underneath the words, that gave him a clue.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that something, Jim?&#8221; he went on, invitingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;War his darter, Little Lina, ther purtiest an&#8217; sweetest gal in
all the Maine woods,&#8221; the guide made answer. &#8220;When he sez as haow I
never cud hev her with all her carin&#8217; fur me so much, I jest up an&#8217;
run away with her; an&#8217; thet&#8217;s why Ole Cale, he hates me wuss nor
cold pizen!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>TAKING A RISK FOR THE SAKE OF LITTLE LINA.</span></h2>

<p>Thad understood it all now, and the knowledge gave him a thrill. He thrust
out his hand to the young guide, with boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake, Jim!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I just know you did what any
decent man would have done. And so you managed to run away with the old
man&#8217;s daughter, did you? Was she all he had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On&#8217;y Little Lina; an&#8217; he believed the sun rose an&#8217; set in
her, like. They cud all say as Cale Martin war a bad man, an&#8217; he
<i>war</i> rough as they make &#8217;em, sumtimes; but he&#8217;d a laid down
his life fur thet gal, any day. I was dead sorry tuh hev tuh do hit; but I
knowed he&#8217;d never give in, an&#8217; I jest cudn&#8217;t live without her.
We gut outen this deestrict while Cale war off on a hunt, an&#8217; I
hain&#8217;t never seen hide nor hair o&#8217; him sense. But he sent me word
thet ef so be I ever kim back tuh the old stampin&#8217; grounds, he hed it in
fuh me, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long ago was that, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nigh a yeah an&#8217; er half now,&#8221; the other replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>&#8220;And of
course your wife has often wished she could see her father again,
Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cried her putty eyes out, awantin&#8217; tuh see her dad,&#8221; he
admitted; &#8220;but what cud a man do &#8217;bout hit, if Cale, he wudn&#8217;t
forgive me? He sent word as haow Lina cud kim back, but me, never; an&#8217; in
course she wudn&#8217;t quit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now, Jim; tell me about who gave you the orders you were saying
something about a while ago?&#8221; pursued Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;She done hit, in course,&#8221; answered the other, heaving a sigh.
&#8220;I knowed the risk I war takin&#8217;, but I&#8217;d do a right smart more
fur my Lina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then as I take it, Jim, you don&#8217;t really want to avoid Old Cale,
this fiery father-in-law of yours; in fact, you mean to see him face to
face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got ter,&#8221; replied the other, laconically; &#8220;&#8217;cause she sez
so. Hit may be I kin do hit on the way up to the lakes; but if not then
I&#8217;m acomin&#8217; back with Eli an&#8217; the canoes thisaways, arter yuh
gits aboard ther train; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll hang around this deestrict till we
meets. Never&#8217;d dar&#8217; show myself tuh her, &#8217;less I done everything
agoin&#8217; tuh kerry it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you feel a little uneasy about your ears,
Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, it wudn&#8217;t be jest the nicest thing agoin&#8217; tuh lose
&#8217;em; but she sez as haow Ole Cale, he&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> bound tuh cave when he hears what I
gotter tuh tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently Jim had said all he meant to, and Thad took the hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I want to say is that I admire your nerve, Jim; and the lot
of us will stand back of you if you get in any trouble,&#8221; he remarked,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s right nice in yuh tuh say thet, sir, an&#8217; sure I
&#8217;predate hit,&#8221; the guide went on to say, with a tremor in his voice;
&#8220;but arter all, I guess thar hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; tuh be any row, if
me&#8217;n Cale, we kims tergether. I&#8217;m willin&#8217; tuh resk it. But I must
say as haow I don&#8217;t like the ijee o&#8217; him asettin&#8217; thar in them
bushes, aimin&#8217; his gun at me. But Cale Martin&#8217;s a squar man, as
wudn&#8217;t shoot daown another without givin&#8217; him a show. An&#8217; I
guess he jest done it fur fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Thad went back to the fire, and sat down. But he did not join in the merry
talk that was going around. His thoughts were wholly given up to Jim and his
story. He liked the short guide more than ever; and in the same proportion
detested the big Maine backwoodsman whose daughter Jim had run away with.</p>

<p>Presently some of the boys complained of feeling sleepy, and arrangements
were made for passing the night.</p>

<p>Both Jim and Eli declared that it would be only the part of wisdom to keep
watch. There could <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
be no telling what deviltry Cale Martin, assisted by his two congenial spirits,
Si Kedge and Ed Harkness, might attempt to do. Perhaps, thinking that it would
reflect on the guides if they annoyed the party whom Eli and Jim were convoying
into the Maine woods, they might even try to set fire to the camp, and thus
spoil the entire trip.</p>

<p>When morning came Thad and Allan had taken their turn at standing sentry; but
none of the other scouts were called upon, because the leader did not have the
greatest of confidence in their ability to remain awake, not to mention hearing,
and comprehending, any sounds that might arise, and which spelled danger.</p>

<p>A consultation in the morning showed that only once had there been heard
suspicious sounds. It was while Allan held the fort; and he declared that to the
best of his knowledge they were far distant voices on the river. But although he
listened carefully, and was prepared to give the alarm if necessary, nothing
further developed that might be considered a peril to the camp.</p>

<p>The boys were feeling pretty good that morning. They had most of them enjoyed
a fine sleep, and were as active as young colts.</p>

<p>Davy in particular seemed to be full of animal spirits; and when he felt like
it, there was no end of the capers the athletic gymnast could do. One minute he
was hanging from his toes from a high <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_62'></a>62</span> limb, looking like a monkey; and the next he had let
go, whirled over three times in the air, and landed lightly on his feet on the
soft ground; after which he would make his little bow, just like the celebrated
performer in the great and only Barnum&#8217;s Circus, after he has thrilled the
audience with one of his marvelous acts.</p>

<p>Bumpus sat and watched all these performances with open mouth. Secretly the
fat boy aspired to imitate Davy in some of his antics; though Giraffe always
scoffed loudly at the absurd idea of a heavy weight like Bumpus trying to play
the part of a nimble ape.</p>

<p>Several times had the ambition of Bumpus got the better of his judgment, and
he had endeavored to follow in the wake of the active member of the party; but
always with disastrous results; so that for some time now he had taken it out in
gaping, and wishing, and longing for the time to come when he could get rid of
his surplus fat, so that he might be nimble like Davy.</p>

<p>Giraffe during breakfast was unusually silent and sober. Thad guessed where
his thoughts were straying, and consequently it did not surprise him in the
least to overhear the tall boy muttering to himself, while he shook his head
stubbornly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n do it all right; I just <i>know</i> I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Step Hen amused himself watching a sharp-eyed little striped chipmunk
stealing some bits <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
thrown aside from the camp meal. Time was when Step Hen might have been guilty
of trying to hit such a fair mark with a club or a stone; but that was in the
past. He would not have lifted a finger now to injure that innocent little
creature for worlds; but sat there, deeply interested in observing every
movement it made, just as if it were a pet.</p>

<p>Jim seemed to be himself again; at least when Thad looked toward him
inquiringly, the guide nodded his head, and smiled. Evidently Jim had slept over
his trouble, and decided that he was doing the right thing. For the sake of
Little Lina he was ready to go right along, taking big chances of losing his
precious ears; for only too well did he know that Old Cale was a man of his
word; and that he must have meant everything he said to the messenger who bore
the threat to Jim.</p>

<p>Davy was wild to develop the film upon which he had taken that snapshot
picture on the preceding night; but there were a number of obstacles in the way
of doing that. First of all, there were five other exposures on that roll, as
yet untouched; and as a clinching argument, Davy had not bothered bringing a
developing tank, or printing outfit along with him, fearing that they would take
up too much room.</p>

<p>And so he would have to be content to wait until they reached some place
where a photographer held forth, who would undertake to do the job, for a
consideration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>Of course the
picture of that breakfast would hardly be complete without Step Hen suddenly
breaking forth in his customary strain:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my&#8211;oh, here it is, on my head, of course! How
queer that I should forget I put it there,&#8221; and he had to actually take
his hat off, and look at it, as if hardly able to believe his eyes, and that for
once his anticipated difficulty had been smoothed over so easily.</p>

<p>Davy joined in the general laugh that greeted this outbreak; then he walked
gravely over, and insisted on feeling of Step Hen&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! what you up to, now, you Jones boy? Keep your paws off me!&#8221;
exclaimed the object of this solicitude, suspiciously dodging.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to make sure that the connection was sound still,&#8221;
retorted the other; &#8220;because some fine day, all of us expect you to lose
your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen you lose yours more&#8217;n a few times, when
you got flustrated and excited; and it didn&#8217;t seem to hurt much,&#8221;
Step Hen retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big difference in heads,&#8221; remarked Davy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say there was,&#8221; replied the other, meaningly;
&#8220;and the gray stuff that&#8217;s in &#8217;em, too. Some are hollow, like
a punkin; while others, mine for instance, are just crammed full of
thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d advise you to use a few of the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> thinks trying to remember where you put
your belongings; and quit accusing the rest of us of playing tricks on you; or a
silly little jinx of stealing things.&#8221; Davy went on, shaking his finger at
the careless scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;If all you fellows are done eating, perhaps we&#8217;d better get a
move on us,&#8221; suggested the scoutmaster; of course Thad was really only the
assistant, for according to the regulations governing all troops of Boy Scouts
connected with the parent organization, there had to be a grown-up acting in the
capacity of scoutmaster; though Thad had passed an examination that entitled him
to receive his commission as assistant, from the headquarters in New York
City.</p>

<p>As this gentleman, a Dr. Philander Hobbs, had been unable to get away with
them on this trip to Maine, he had relegated his authority to the shoulders of
Thad; a proceeding that was greatly relished by the other five scouts, because
they liked to feel that they were depending on themselves, with no grown-up
along.</p>

<p>Accordingly there was a movement among the campers. Tents had to come down,
and be stowed away; and all the material connected with the cooking department
made into as small a compass as possible.</p>

<p>All of them worked but Giraffe, who was on his knees near by, doing something
that Thad could <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
easily guess the nature of. Knowing the stubborn qualities in the angular scout
Thad felt sure that none of them would know any peace until Giraffe had finally
managed to strike a clue, and effect the end he had in view, of making an actual
boni-fide fire after the way known to the South Sea Islanders, with his little
bow, his sharp-pointed stick set in a hole made in a block of wood, and his
inflammable tinder, backed by indomitable energy, and &#8220;get there&#8221;
spirit.</p>

<p>And for the sake of harmony in the camp, Thad really wished Giraffe would
hurry up, and solve the knotty problem.</p>

<p>Inside of half an hour they were all packed, and ready to make another start
in the direction of the Eagle chain of lakes to the north.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LONG-DRAWN HOWL OF A CANADA WOLF.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;All ready!&#8221; sang out Thad.</p>

<p>Some of them were already settled in the canoes; but Giraffe still remained,
kneeling on the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, we&#8217;ve waited long enough for you, old Slow-poke!&#8221;
called out Bumpus, who was the partner of the tall scout in the canoe paddled by
Eli.</p>

<p>Very slowly did Giraffe approach, his eyes turned beseechingly on Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s the way it always goes,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I
was just getting on to it the best ever, and if I only had half an hour more,
I&#8217;d made my fire as sure as I&#8217;m Conrad Stedman. I&#8217;ve got her
all figgered out; and by noon I&#8217;ll be twisted in my mind again, and the
whole combination lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Thad only shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t think of it, Number Six,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It
was one part of the agreement made with you that on no occasion were you to
delay the balance of the party. All ready; Bumpus, give the signal.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>Bumpus was a
natural musician. He could play &#8220;any old instrument,&#8221; and extract
very good music from banjo, guitar, violin, or even an accordion; he also had a
fine voice that often aroused the enthusiastic acclaim of his comrades while
sitting around the fire of evenings.</p>

<p>Of course, then, he had been made the bugler of the troop as soon as the
organization was commenced. It had not been deemed just the right thing for him
to fetch his musical instrument along while the Silver Fox Patrol chanced to be
in the Maine woods on a hunt; but then that was no bar to Bumpus, who could put
his hands to his mouth, and give a splendid imitation of the reveille, assembly,
taps, or any other military call.</p>

<p>So Giraffe had to climb into Eli&#8217;s canoe, looking very much
discouraged. Really, it did seem as though an evil spirit took especial delight
in baffling him, just when he seemed in a fair way to reach the goal of his
present ambition. As he had once before complained, he had even had his tinder
soaked by a sudden shower, and just at the critical moment when he felt sure it
was about to burst into a successful blaze.</p>

<p>But one thing was sure, these successive defeats only served to make him shut
his teeth harder together, and resolve that nothing would ever prevent him from
getting that fire, if it took him a year. He might be beaten once, twice, or
fifty times; but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
there would come a day to the patient plodder when the door of opportunity would
open for him. And surely success would stand for a great deal more if he had to
work like this for it, than if easily attained.</p>

<p>Before noon came they had arrived at the place where the stream ran into the
Lower Lake of the Eagle Chain; and when they stopped for lunch, it was upon the
shore of this beautiful sheet of water.</p>

<p>Thad had been secretly keeping an eye on Jim. He knew that the guide must
feel more or less anxiety, despite his brave outward showing. And when Jim
thought no one was observing he would look out of the tail of his eye at every
clump of bushes that seemed any way suspicious, as long as they were upon the
river.</p>

<p>And hence, it was doubtless a positive relief when they started out on the
broader water of the lake; for after that he would only have to watch one
shore.</p>

<p>About one o&#8217;clock they again started. The air continued cold, but
bracing, and this made paddling a pleasure, up to a certain point.</p>

<p>All of the scouts took a hand at it, even Bumpus, and received more or less
valuable instruction from the two guides, as to how the paddle should be worked
in order to have as little &#8220;lost motion&#8221; as possible; and at the
same time secure the greatest amount of benefit. But when after half an hour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span> of labor, they found
their muscles beginning to tire from the unaccustomed motion, the boys
considered themselves lucky to be able to turn the paddles over once more to the
canoe men, who were used to the job, and could keep it up steadily all day, if
need be.</p>

<p>When they drew near the outlet where the waters of the Lower Lake flowed into
Lake Winthrop, Thad, happening to look back, managed to discover a canoe
skirting the shore some miles distant. From the actions of those in it, they
seemed desirous of remaining unnoticed; for they took advantage of every
headland that jutted out; and when they had to make across the open, it was done
with all possible speed.</p>

<p>Thad did not need to be told who was in that craft. And glancing toward Jim,
he understood that the Maine guide had doubtless been aware of the pursuing
canoe for some time; because he nodded at the scoutmaster when he caught his
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him, is it, Jim?&#8221; called out Thad; for the canoes
were some thirty feet apart at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; came the answer, accompanied by an affirmative nod of
Jim&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him, even at that distance, then?&#8221; continued the patrol
leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s workin&#8217; the paddle right now,&#8221; replied the
other. &#8220;Yuh cain&#8217;t mistake his way o&#8217; swingin&#8217; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> ther spruce blade. Ole
Cale hain&#8217;t gut his ekal at thet in all the State o&#8217;
Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen, then, that the giant poacher was on the trail of his
detested son-in-law, possibly bent on carrying out his terrible threat; though
Thad hoped such might not prove to be the case.</p>

<p>He knew that often these rough men of the woods could appreciate true
bravery; and that there <i>might</i> be a chance, however slight, that Old Cale
was lost in admiration for the recklessnes that could induce Jim to brave his
wrath. What if he had been consumed by a sudden deep curiosity to know what
really caused the other to take the risk and come up here? Could he suspect that
Little Lina had sent a message to him?</p>

<p>All these things gave Thad occasion for considerable thinking. At the same
time he did not mean to lose sight of the main reason for their having come so
far from their homes, in order to get some hunting, and camping experience, that
would prove valuable to his fellow scouts, anxious to learn all that they could
at first hands, of wood-craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we were as particular as we were about putting out the
very last spark of fire this morning,&#8221; Thad remarked, as the canoes moved
along close to one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Giraffe, a little suspiciously; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span> for every time that
magical word was used he chose to think all eyes must be turned in his
direction; just as though he should be placed in the same class with fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! because the wind came up like great guns shortly after we left
camp,&#8221; Thad went on, always ready to point a lesson to those under him;
&#8220;and from the river, too. Now, if we&#8217;d left any fire there, the
chances are it would have been picked up, and thrown into the woods. As there
was a lot of dry stuff around, you can see how easy a fire starts up here. And
when it once gets going, I reckon it can burn some, eh, Allan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ever have the good or bad luck to run across a forest afire,
while we&#8217;re up in this section, you&#8217;ll see a sight that none of
you&#8217;ll soon forget,&#8221; and he had to cast a meaning glance as he spoke
in the direction of the fire worshipper.</p>

<p>But Giraffe only smiled in a satisfied way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk all you want,&#8221; he remarked; &#8220;but I think I&#8217;ve
got that business down fine, now; and to-night, <i>to-night</i> I&#8217;m just
bound to prove to Bumpus here that the cream is on him. I knew I&#8217;d get it
sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t crow till you&#8217;re out of the woods,&#8221;
remarked Bumpus, from the bow end of the canoe. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to be
convinced; and it&#8217;ll be worth all it costs me just to see you work that
puzzle out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;But you
just know I c&#8217;n do it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; persisted Giraffe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t say,&#8221; answered the fat boy, obstinately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might as well be counting up your spare cash, because
I&#8217;m bound to show you at the first chance. It just <i>can&#8217;t</i> slip
away from me much longer; and I reckon I&#8217;ve got it clinched this
time,&#8221; and after that Giraffe would not talk, but seemed to be muttering
to himself from time to time, as though he might be repeating a certain formula
that he believed to be the winning combination.</p>

<p>They were not trying to make fast time now, because there was really no
necessity for doing so. Having arrived on the chain of lakes that, with the St.
Johns river, almost makes a great island of the northern portion of Maine, they
were bent on enjoying themselves. That meant going into camp at some point where
the guides were agreed they might have the best hunting; and from that time on
taking toll of the woods&#8217; folks as their larder required, wasting nothing,
and refraining from hunting when food was not needed.</p>

<p>They were true scouts, and believed in following the uplifting principles
that govern the actions of the better class of sportsmen. As Step Hen so often
declared, they did not want to be called &#8220;game hogs,&#8221; a term often
used to describe the man who flings his catch of bass or trout up on the shore
to die, no matter if he is taking ten times <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_74'></a>74</span> what he can use; or who shoots his deer in or out of
season, and allows it to lie there, wasted, on the ground, food for the foxes or
wolves.</p>

<p>&#8220;This country seems to be rather sparsely settled up here?&#8221;
remarked Thad, after they had been moving along the shore of Lake Winthrop for
some time, looking up a desirable camp site.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the summer you kin see a tent now an&#8217; then, it bein&#8217;
sum party as wants ter enjy the fishin&#8217;, which is prime,&#8221; Eli
replied; &#8220;but they ain&#8217;t many folks as keer &#8217;bout
stickin&#8217; out ther winters hyar. Ye&#8217;ll admit they must be sum cold,
this far up, nigh the Canady border.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be plenty of game hereabouts, I should guess,&#8221;
Thad went on. &#8220;Because, in the first place it has a gamey look to me; and
then again, you wouldn&#8217;t have agreed to come along with Jim here, unless
you&#8217;d heard good accounts of the region around the Eagle Lakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest what I has, though I hain&#8217;t never be&#8217;n all over &#8217;em
myself,&#8221; returned Eli. &#8220;But Jim hyar, he was bawn an&#8217; fetched
up in this kentry; so what he doan&#8217;t know &#8217;baout hit hain&#8217;t wuth
knowin&#8217;, I guess, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon that Jim declared they had reached
the point where their tents should be pitched. Thad noticed that the guide made
not the least attempt at trying to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_75'></a>75</span> hide the camp; indeed, the tents could surely be seen
in any direction out on the lake.</p>

<p>This gave him to understand that Jim was not &#8220;taking water;&#8221; he
had come here to this danger ground with the main idea of meeting his irate
father-in-law face to face, be the consequences what they might, because his
wife had begged him to; and there was as yet no sign of Jim turning out to be
what Giraffe called a &#8220;quitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody soon found plenty to do. The rest had enough pity for Giraffe not
to enter any complaint because he seemed to shirk his share of the ordinary
labor attending the starting of the camp. They knew he had his hands full in
solving what promised to be one of the greatest puzzles he had ever tackled.</p>

<p>And so he was allowed to go off himself, and work his little saw monotonously
right along. Now it was the cord that failed to hold; again something else went
back on poor Giraffe. But he kept patiently at it, grimly determined; and even
the most interested of the lot, Bumpus, with whom the fire builder had laid his
little wager, could not but feel a touch of admiration and sympathy when he saw
how the tall scout kept at his task as the afternoon slipped away.</p>

<p>When supper was announced Giraffe came in smiling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>&#8220;Got
it?&#8221; demanded Bumpus, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just as good as done,&#8221; was the cautious reply.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve mastered a heap of little irritating troubles; and just now
the coast seems to be clear. Next time, now, and you&#8217;ll see something
doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One more ribber to cross!&#8221; cooed Step Hen. &#8220;It&#8217;s
always &#8216;next time,&#8217; with Giraffe, you notice, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Giraffe was either too tired to argue, or else so confident of a speedy
success that he felt he could afford to bide his time. Revenge would be very
sweet, after all the chaff the fellows had poured upon his head. He would
wait.</p>

<p>The supper tasted unusually fine that night, they all declared. Several of
the scouts assisted in its preparation, wishing to show the guides just what
knowledge of camp cookery they had picked up in their numerous outings. Even
Bumpus superintended the heating of the &#8220;canoeist&#8217;s delight,&#8221;
which turned out to be a hodge-podge, consisting of some left-over corned beef
taken from a tin, some corn, and beans with several cold potatoes sliced in the
same. And the hungry boys declared the only fault they could find with it was
that it disappeared too soon.</p>

<p>But they had an abundance for all hands, even Giraffe admitting that he was
satisfied when the meal was over. Then came the several delightful hours of
lying around, as close to the cheery blaze as they <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> dared, and having a &#8220;good old
fashioned powwow,&#8221; as Step Hen called it.</p>

<p>Jim was quiet; but then he had never been a noisy fellow; and knowing what
was on his mind right then, Thad felt that he had plenty of excuse for deep
thought.</p>

<p>During a lull in the conversation later on, Bumpus sat upright, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, did any of you hear it again; sure as you live it was the same
long-drawn howl we caught on our other trip up the Penobscot region; and
Sebattis, as well as all the rest, told us it was a wolf come down across the
border from Canada. How about it Eli; was that one just then giving
tongue?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old guide had not moved an inch; indeed, he seemed to be very little
concerned over the strange sound; but he nodded his shaggy head, and made
reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, thet war a Canady wolf all right; an&#8217; as they hunt in packs
thar must be more on &#8217;em raound these diggin&#8217;s I spect.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE UPLIFT OF A BOY SCOUT.</span></h2>

<p>They all listened, and heard the far-away howl several more times. Eli even
declared that it was not the same beast that gave tongue, but a different one;
and this seemed to bear out his statement that the animals usually hunted in
packs. If a bunch of them had crossed the St. Johns river, and taken to chasing
deer in the forbidden territory of Maine, the tidings would soon spread, and
every guide be on the lookout.</p>

<p>&#8220;If so be ye run acrost ary wolves, knock &#8217;em over like
vermin,&#8221; Eli remarked, during the discussion of the subject that
followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess everybody&#8217;s got his hand raised against the poor old
wolf, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; asked Bumpus; who often felt sorry for the
underdog in a fight, no matter if it happened to be a strange cur he had never
set eyes on before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Thad, immediately; &#8220;when the wolf is no
respecter of persons, and will pull down anything that can be used for food? The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span> world over, they are
hunted, because they do so much harm. It has always been so from the time the
shepherds of Bible times tended their flocks on the hills of Galilee. And as
long as living things stay on this old globe, man and wolf will never
agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in every State where they used to run, there has always been
declared a fat bounty on wolves,&#8221; Allan observed. &#8220;Why, right now,
Maine is paying large sums of money to get rid of her vermin, such as wolves,
wildcats, panthers and snakes. I&#8217;ve read that as much as four hundred
thousand dollars has been paid out in bounties since nineteen-three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Thad, &#8220;and that&#8217;s where the joke comes
in. I read that same article, which was mighty interesting too. It went on to
state that some smarties are not content with getting the regular bounty. They
grow a gray cat that looks on the order of the wild article&#8211;shorten the
tail, draw out the claws, and then send in the skin, claiming the six dollars
that is paid for each bobcat actually slain within the borders of the
State.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the turn of old Eli to laugh now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard tell o&#8217; a sharper as cut off the rattles from a lot
o&#8217; tame snakes he kept shut up, and send &#8217;em in for the bounties
each rattle brings; and then he expects his pets ter grow new rattles, which
howsumever, I don&#8217;t guess they kin; but thet air story <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> goes ter show what some
men will try an&#8217; do ter beat the pore old government people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! and I just can&#8217;t stand for snakes at all,&#8221; remarked
Step Hen. &#8220;If ever I felt one touch me, I believe I&#8217;d nearly take a
fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! let Davy do that!&#8221; cried Giraffe, quickly; at which there
was a shout that must have made the two guides stare, until the joke was
explained to them.</p>

<p>It seemed that once upon a time Davy had been subject to sudden severe cramps
in his stomach, that used to double him up like a hinge, and render him
incapable of action. His teachers at school had been duly warned, and many an
afternoon had Davy been granted leave to go home because of a sudden attack;
though it must have departed as suddenly as it came; since he was generally seen
flying his kite on that same afternoon. And the cramps never attacked him on a
dull, rainy day.</p>

<p>When he joined the scouts Davy, wishing to shirk hard work, had commenced to
have these queer cramps; but wise Thad, believing that the other must long ago
have outgrown the disorder, and was only shamming, laid down a course of
treatment so severe that, singular to relate, Davy had ever since been utterly
free from the infliction; which the rest of the boys considered simply
wonderful.</p>

<p>And that was why there was a shout, with all <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_81'></a>81</span> eyes turned toward Davy Jones, when by mere accident
Step Hen mentioned the word &#8220;fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Davy only colored up a bit, and grinned amiably.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a dead issue, fellers, so you needn&#8217;t stare at me
that way,&#8221; he remarked, composedly. &#8220;Never again. Thad cured me
right off the reel. &#8216;Nothing like heroic treatment, when all else fails,&#8217;
he said; and it did the job, clean as a whistle. I never can have a fit again,
if I tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not,&#8221; remarked Bumpus, solemnly winking his
left eye at Step Hen, and significantly touching a good-sized club he had at his
side.</p>

<p>But that howling of the wolves, hunting their supper far away, did not keep
the boys from enjoying a good night&#8217;s sleep. Of course there was some sort
of watch kept; but those who were not entrusted with the vigil had no reason to
bother their heads over it. All night long they slept in absolute safety. If
Eli, Jim, Allan and the scoutmaster took turns being on deck, to make sure the
camp was not raided, that fact did not keep the other four from slumbering as
peacefully as though tucked in their beds at home, and under the parental
roof.</p>

<p>Another dawn found them awake, and only too anxious to get a good warm fire
started; for the frost was surely around them, and at that early hour it bit
severely, too. But they could always depend on Giraffe to coax the wood to do
its best <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> in
dispelling the cold atmosphere; and soon they were no longer shivering, but
fully dressed, and assisted in getting breakfast.</p>

<p>Thad cast his eye upward several times during the progress of the meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be anxious about something Mr. Scout Master?&#8221;
remarked Step Hen, who had been highly favored that morning, being chosen to
accompany the leader on a hunt for fresh meat; and Step Hen was therefore more
interested than the others in what seemed to have aroused the attention of
Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering whether we mightn&#8217;t get our first snow-storm
before another sundown, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; replied the other, with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, however could you tell that, when everything looks bright, and
oh-be-joyful to me up yonder?&#8221; burst out the wondering Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are some things one can know, partly by instinct, and find
it pretty hard to explain,&#8221; Thad went on to say. &#8220;I seem to feel a
something in the air that says &#8216;snow&#8217; as plain as words. It may be just a
sort of dampness; but that&#8217;s the way about it. Then I notice the direction
of the wind, which is northwest; and the cut of those few cirrus clouds lying
low near the horizon. I can&#8217;t exactly explain so that you could
understand, but if I was asked my opinion, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ll see the
snow flakes flying before many hours.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;How about
that?&#8221; demanded Step Hen, turning on Eli and Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right, &#8217;cause thar&#8217;s agoin&#8217; ter be summat
o&#8217; a fall. P&#8217;raps &#8217;twon&#8217;t amount ter much, nobody kin tell that; but
it sez snow, all right,&#8221; the first guide observed, after taking a look all
around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me tew,&#8221; was all Jim said; but he accompanied the words with a
vigorous nod in the affirmative, that stood for a lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; Step Hen declared. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out
prepared for business. Never did like to be snowed under, any way you take
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad we ain&#8217;t got a snow shovel along,&#8221; remarked
Giraffe, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you can joke all you want to,&#8221; snapped back the other;
&#8220;you&#8217;re so lofty you needn&#8217;t mind an ordinary snowfall. If it
got up to your chin, you could still manage to stretch that rubber neck of yours
around, and feel comfortable. But I ain&#8217;t in the same class, you see, with
my ordinary figure, and short neck. But all I meant to say was, that I&#8217;d
keep my sweater on under my coat, and stick my woolen gloves in my
pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loan you my earmuffs if you say the word, Step Hen,&#8221; spoke up
Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, that&#8217;s decent of you, Bumpus,&#8221; the other scout
remarked; &#8220;but you see, this old corduroy cap of mine has earflaps that
can be turned down. It&#8217;s just a bully thing for a cold, windy <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span> day. But after such a
generous offer, Bumpus, why, I give you my full permission to turn over your
badge. You&#8217;ve begun the day bright and early, by trying to do a generous
deed for a comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, what Step Hen referred to was the well-known rule by which the
great body of members composing the Boy Scouts&#8217; organization of America
has been governed, in order to teach the units of each patrol and troop the
benefits to be derived from making themselves useful to others.</p>

<p>In the morning every scout is supposed to pin his badge upside-down, on the
lapel of his coat; and is not allowed to change its position until he has found
an opportunity for helping some one, either by act, or advice that is really
useful. It may only be a very simple thing; but it teaches the lad, first of
all, the useful attribute of observation; and after that the still more precious
one of service. Even though he but assist an old man across a street where
vehicles are numerous; or take a market basket from the hands of a housewife,
who is staggering homeward under the heavy burden, the effect is the same.</p>

<p>It makes his boyish heart thrill with a satisfaction that develops the trait
of generosity; and gives every lad a more manly sensation; for he realizes that
small though he may seem, he is of some value to the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Bumpus, blushing, &#8220;I guess I hadn&#8217;t ought
to take advantage of such a little thing as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_85'></a>85</span> that, so&#8217;s to get my badge turned. I&#8217;ll
find a chance to do something that&#8217;s more worth while, before the
morning&#8217;s an hour old. And Step Hen, if you bring home the bacon in the
shape of a noble six-pronged buck, you must let me take your picture, with your
foot on the prize. Why, it will be the most valuable heirloom in your family,
years from now. Your great grandchildren will point to it in pride, and tell how
you slew the Jabberwock in the woods of Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; grinned Step Hen, &#8220;wait till I get the buck. I
don&#8217;t count my chickens before they&#8217;re hatched. And I hope for one
thing&#8211;that when we do come back, there&#8217;s going to be a little peace
in the camp; and that our friend Giraffe here, will have solved the riddle
that&#8217;s been worrying him so long. Them&#8217;s my sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giraffe made a mock bow, as he remarked in his most amiable way:</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged for making that wish, Step Hen; and from present
indications I&#8217;ve got a sort of hunch that something is going to happen
along them lines. Woke up in the night after having a dream, and it all came to
me like a flash, where I&#8217;d been making a mistake. And as soon as I get
through eating, I&#8217;m going to work trying to start things just like I saw
in my dream. Oh! I&#8217;ll get there, sooner or later, by hook or by crook. You
never saw me give a thing up yet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;Hey!
what&#8217;s that?&#8221; remarked Davy Jones, quickly. &#8220;How about that
time you got in old farmer Collins&#8217; watermelon patch one night, and hooked
a nice big melon he had doctored, so as to teach the boys a lesson. Oh! I know,
because I was along with the crowd; and seems to me you gave up everything you
owned, during that never-to-be-forgotten hour. I know I did; and I&#8217;ve
never eaten a melon since without shivering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, quit that melancholy subject, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded
Bumpus. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to be reminded of my wicked past, because
I&#8217;ve turned over a new leaf since I joined the scouts. Why, you
couldn&#8217;t tempt me now with the biggest grandfather watermelon ever grown.
B-r-r! It makes me shake, just to remember some things that happened in those
old days, when I went with Giraffe, and Davy Jones, and the rest of that
lark-loving crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Thad and Step Hen started out, guns in hand. Knowing
that the patrol leader was perfectly at home in the woods, no one bothered about
giving them advice; or predicting all manner of direful calamities ahead. Let it
snow and blow as it pleased, Thad was enough of a woodsman to know how to make
himself comfortable, and get back to the camp on the lake shore in due
season.</p>

<p>Of course Bumpus had been more or less disappointed because he did not have
an early chance to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
prove the merits of his new gun, since he had been taking private lessons from
one of the guides in the way of handling firearms. But Thad had promised that
the fat boy and Giraffe should have the next chance for a hunt; they were
canoemates, and seemed often thrown together, perhaps because they represented
the &#8220;fat and the lean of it,&#8221; and as Bumpus was fond of saying,
&#8220;extremes meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, and the two young Nimrods had managed to get a couple of
miles from the camp. But as yet they had not sighted that wonderful six-pronged
buck which Step Hen was to lay low. They walked along about fifty feet apart,
Thad generously allowing his companion to be a little in advance of him. This he
did really because he wished Step Hen to have the advantage of the first shot;
being confident that if the other failed to bring down the game he would still
have some show before the deer could vanish from sight.</p>

<p>Then again, it was just as well to have Step Hen in front. He was inclined to
be nervous; and some sudden whirr of wings, as a partridge flew out of a nearby
thicket, might cause his finger to press on the trigger of his gun a little
harder than he intended. Thad believed in being on the safe side, every
time.</p>

<p>Step Hen carried a lovely little repeating rifle of the thirty-thirty type;
and his ammunition was of the soft-nosed kind, which, as it
&#8220;mushrooms&#8221; on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_88'></a>88</span> striking, is just as serviceable as a ball three
times as large; while Thad had his double-barrel Marlin shotgun, a twelve bore,
with buckshot shells meant for big game.</p>

<p>As they were passing through what seemed to be a tangle such as is seldom met
with in the pine woods of Maine, where they had to dodge trailing vines, Step
Hen, in trying to avoid one that threatened to catch him by the neck, managed to
stumble over a log, and go sprawling forward, his gun flying from his grip, but
fortunately not going off. But immediately Step Hen commenced to thresh around,
as he shouted out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thad! Oh! Thad, hurry up, and help me out of this! My legs are twisted
in the vine; and something bit me! I know it must a been a rattlesnake, and
I&#8217;m a goner!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX.<br /><span class='h2fs'>STEP HEN&#8217;S GREAT LUCK.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Snakes! well, Step Hen, you&#8217;re away off, if you think
they&#8217;re ever found out, with the weather as biting as it is right
now!&#8221; laughed Thad; who sized up the situation instantly, and knew full
well there was nothing of the sort the matter with his hunting companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, <i>something</i> gave me a bite, and you can see the
blood on my hand right now, Thad,&#8221; whined Step Hen, crawling once more
into view, and looking as though he could not be convinced to the contrary of
his statement, just because of a little frost.</p>

<p>He held up his left hand as he spoke. Thad took hold of it, and with those
keen eyes of his, managed to grapple with the facts immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You only managed to strike up against a sliver of wood, and got a
splinter in your hand,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;see here, I can show
you,&#8221; saying which he used the nails of his finger and thumb for a
forceps, and drew out a little splinter that had pushed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span> under the skin, just far enough to bring
a drop or two of blood, and give Step Hen a sharp pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! thank you, Thad!&#8221; exclaimed the other, as though vastly
relieved. &#8220;You see, I just detest all kinds of crawlers the worst kind;
and that talk about rattlers, and the bounty paid for their tails, must have
been hanging on my mind. When I felt that sudden sharp jab, of course the first
thing that flashed into my brain was that I&#8217;d tumbled on the nest of a
rattlesnake, and he took me for one of the bounty jumpers. But only a sliver of
wood&#8211;huh, I can stand that easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suck it good and plenty,&#8221; advised the far seeing Thad. &#8220;I
always do as soon as I get a cut of any kind, and especially if it&#8217;s a
splinter. Sometimes it keeps you from getting poison in your system, that makes
a bad sore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Step Hen obediently did as he was told. At least he had implicit confidence
in the patrol leader, and was ready to follow his advice under the slightest
provocation. That was a feather in the cap of Thad Brewster, in that he
possessed the full confidence of his comrades. They believed in him, and were
never in a state of mutiny concerning the orders he gave, as leader of the
Silver Fox Patrol.</p>

<p>Once more the two boys tramped on. Thad thought it might be as well to impart
a little useful information concerning the dormant condition of all snakes
during winter time; and how many a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> bunch of the wrigglers he had found, while the cold
season was on, looking as though they were frozen stiff.</p>

<p>This information he imparted in almost a whisper as they moved along. When
out looking for deer, a muffler on speech is of paramount importance; and
knowing all about this, Thad soon relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you more some other time, Step Hen,&#8221; he remarked as a
wind-up; &#8220;that is, if you care to hear more about snakes. No matter how
you dislike the breed, you really ought to know more than you seem to, about
their habits. It might be the means of saving you from trouble some fine day,
when, by accident, you happen to run across some reptile in the woods. And now
we&#8217;ll forget all that. I&#8217;m not going to say another word, unless I
have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>They kept pushing on; and Step Hen began to believe they must be many miles
from their starting point; at any rate he began to feel a little heavy-footed,
though too proud to mention the fact to Thad. Besides, Step Hen had walked
pretty good distances before, and believed that he must soon get what he called
his &#8220;second wind.&#8221; After that he would be good for hours, he
fancied.</p>

<p>It must have been well on to eleven o&#8217;clock when Thad felt his
companion nudge him in the back. As he turned to look, Step Hen made a
suggestive gesture with his head, and pointed upwards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>There was a dead
gray sky above them, and already a few scattered flakes of snow, really the
first of the season, were drifting downward, looking like tiny feathers plucked
from the downy breast of a snow goose.</p>

<p>Thad simply nodded his head to indicate that he too had observed them; and at
the same time he shook his finger toward Step Hen, afraid lest the other might
be itching to start a conversation. In fact, this was just what the other scout
was hoping to do. This grim silence had begun to work upon his nerves&#8211;just
walking on and on, with not a blessed sign of the fine buck they expected to
get, commenced to pall upon Step Hen, in whom the instincts of a hunter had
never been born; although of late he had begun to develop a taste for roaming
the woods with a gun over his shoulder. But he had much to learn concerning the
secrets that Nature hides from most eyes, but which are as the page of an open
book to the favored few.</p>

<p>Step Hen began to twist his head around frequently. At first Thad thought he
was developing a new eagerness to discover signs of game; but then he soon saw
that the wistful expression on the other&#8217;s face was brought about by quite
a different cause.</p>

<p>To tell the honest truth about it, Step Hen was trying to figure out in his
benighted brain just what the cardinal points of the compass might be. It <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span> was not that he possessed
any alarming interest in proving certain facts Thad and Allan had explained,
concerning the fascinating game of learning where the north lay by marks on the
trees; the general direction in which they slanted; signs of moss on the north
or northwest side of the tree, and various other well proven methods of locating
one&#8217;s self. Oh! nothing of the kind. Step Hen wanted to find out one
particular fact. They had started <i>north</i> when leaving camp; and now, if he
could only learn that they were heading due south, it would tell him that Thad
had swung around, and was facing back home again; and thus he would not be under
the painful necessity of informing his companion that he was tired of the
useless hunt, when nothing worth while showed up.</p>

<p>And then it happened!</p>

<p>Step Hen happened to have his eyes in the right quarter when suddenly a fine
big buck sprang to its feet, and stared at them a second or two, before starting
to spring away. They had been heading up into the wind all the time, which was a
part of Thad&#8217;s principle as a true still hunter; and the deer had not
known of their presence until the greenhorn happened to step on a small branch,
which snapped under his weight.</p>

<p>Possibly Step Hen never really knew just how he did it. Indeed, he afterwards
confessed to himself that his ready little rifle just seemed to swing <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> upward to his shoulder by
some instinct, which was probably the exact truth; for hunters seldom have time
to do any thinking.</p>

<p>He saw that splendid deer standing there before him. Now, Step Hen had often
fired a target rifle at just such a picture of a deer as this in the shooting
gallery in Cranford. And when he took a hasty aim just behind the shoulder of
the startled buck, he was really following out his usual custom of covering the
bull&#8217;s-eye on the artificial deer, so familiar to his boyish eyes.</p>

<p>Bang! went the rifle, as he pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>Thad had his double-barreled gun in readiness, and could have supplemented
the shot of Step Hen by pouring in a broadside of small bullets that must have
dropped the animal in his tracks. But he refrained, for his instinct seemed to
tell him that the missile from Step Hen&#8217;s little rifle had struck home, as
the buck gave a convulsive leap, and pitched over; and Thad knew how much a new
beginner in the game delights in the knowledge that he has accomplished the work
of bringing down a deer unassisted.</p>

<p>True, the buck managed to scramble to its feet again, and run; but even then
the patrol leader held his fire, for he knew that the animal could not go more
than a hundred or two feet before it must drop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rung the bell then, Thad; didn&#8217;t you hear <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> me?&#8221; almost shrieked Step Hen, so
excited that he never once thought of pumping the exploded cartridge from the
firing chamber of his repeating rifle, and sending a fresh one in after it; and
then, as the stricken buck scrambled to his feet again, and went off at a
wobbling gait the astonished and dismayed Step Hen, who should have been
prepared to send in another shot on his own account, actually forgot that he
held a rifle calculated to repeat, and wildly besought his chum to fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there he&#8217;s going to get away after all, Thad!&#8221; he
cried, jumping up and down in his excitement; &#8220;why don&#8217;t you blaze
away, and knock my buck over? Thad, oh, do let him have it good and hard! There,
now he&#8217;s gone, and we&#8217;ve lost him! It&#8217;s a shame, that&#8217;s
what it is, when I so nearly got him. And he had six prongs too! Oh, me! oh, my!
what tough luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Step Hen,&#8221; said Thad, quickly; &#8220;that
deer can&#8217;t get away. You shot him to pieces, and he&#8217;s just bound to
drop before five minutes. We&#8217;ll just follow him up, and find him lying as
dead as&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just what Thad had in mind as a comparison Step Hen never knew. Perhaps he
was going to say &#8220;as dead as a door nail,&#8221; that being a favorite
expression among the scouts; or it might be Thad meant to take a little flight
into ancient history, and compare the condition of that buck inside of five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span> minutes with the
Julius Caesar of olden Roman times. It did not matter.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sudden loud explosion. The sound came from the
quarter in which the buck had just gone, and could not have been far distant.
And even the tenderfoot understood what it meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! listen to that, would you, Thad?&#8221; he burst forth with.
&#8220;There&#8217;s somebody else hunting up in this neck of the woods, and
they&#8217;ve got my fine buck! Now, ain&#8217;t that the worst thing ever; and
just when it began to look as if he ought to belong to me, too; for you said he
was hard hit; and I just know I rung the bell with that bullet. And now I reckon
it&#8217;s all off. Oh! why <i>didn&#8217;t</i> you knock him over when you had
the chance, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure would if I&#8217;d had the least suspicion that there was any
other hunter around these diggings,&#8221; declared Thad, with a frown on his
usually smooth brow; for he instantly began to scent trouble. &#8220;But come
on, let&#8217;s start along, and see what it all means. Perhaps now old Eli, or
Jim may have wandered out to take a little side hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But anyway, it&#8217;s <i>my</i> buck, Thad; you said I got
him!&#8221; grumbled Step Hen, as he started after his leader.</p>

<p>They had no trouble in following in the direction taken by the stricken deer;
even Step Hen, upon having his attention directed to the ground by Thad, could
readily discern the trail of blood spots that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_97'></a>97</span> told how the buck had been badly hurt by the shot
back of the shoulder.</p>

<p>And less than three minutes later the two scouts came upon a scene that
caused Thad to frown; while Step Hen&#8217;s mouth opened with surprise, even as
his eyes were unduly dilated in his intense excitement.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X.<br /><span class='h2fs'>BARE-FACED ROBBERY IN THE MAINE WOODS.</span></h2>

<p>Three men were bending over the dead deer, and all of them carried rifles.
They were a rough-looking set, all told; and any one would know at a glance that
they could not be city sportsmen, up here in the Maine woods on a hunt; but must
belong to the native class of guides, loggers, or possibly something worse.</p>

<p>One of them was in truth a giant; and as soon as Thad set eyes on this
individual he knew that his worst fears were about to be realized. This could be
no other than the big poacher, Old Cale Martin, the man whom the game wardens
seemed to dread like poison, and had never yet dared arrest, though his breaking
of the laws had become notorious all through that section where he roamed.</p>

<p>Despite his sensation of acute alarm, Thad surveyed the man with more or less
interest and curiosity. He had heard so much about his doings that he would have
actually felt a certain degree of disappointment had he gone away from Maine and
never met Cale Martin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Then, what Jim
Hasty had told him, added to his desire to look upon the face of Little
Lina&#8217;s awful father.</p>

<p>No doubt Step Hen must also have jumped at some sort of right conclusion with
regard to the identity of the three men. The unusual size of the leader was
quite enough in itself to tell who they must be.</p>

<p>Thad did not halt long upon sighting the others, but walked forward. Even
though poachers, this did not mean that the three men were desperate outlaws by
any means. No doubt they walked in and out of the villages in this extreme
northern section of the State, and were greeted by those who knew them as fellow
guides, though seldom were any of them employed in such a capacity nowadays.</p>

<p>Step Hen tagged at the heels of his chum. He did not know what Thad might be
going to do; but although white of face just then, with a sudden fear of
trouble, at least Step Hen showed no sign of running away.</p>

<p>The three men looked up as the boys approached. All of them seemed to be
grinning, as though amused. But while the big man really looked somewhat as a
mastiff might appear to a little terrier, his two companions had a sneer on
their dark, evil faces that gave Thad more or less uneasiness.</p>

<p>He knew that while Step Hen was entitled to that fine buck, the chances were
his claim would never <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> be considered for a single minute. Might made right
in the Maine woods, with men of this stamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! younkers, lookin&#8217; arter yer deer, hey?&#8221; remarked
the giant, as the boys boldly approached. &#8220;Wall, they hain&#8217;t any,
d&#8217;ye see? We got a fine leetle buck here as Si fetched down with his big
bore cannon; only fur him the deer&#8217;s been in ther next county afore now,
eh, Si?&#8221; and the giant as he said this, turned on the man who wore the
greasy suit of buckskin, and sported a coonskin cap, after the style of the
old-time hunters, now so nearly extinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Cale, he&#8217;d a ben agoin&#8217; like two-forty
yet, on&#8217;y for the ounce of lead I throwed into him on the jump. I guess as haow
that leetle pepper box jest tickled him a mite, an&#8217; made him feel frisky.
Step right up, an&#8217; take a look at <i>my</i> buck, ef so be yeou wanter,
strangers; I hain&#8217;t begrudgin&#8217; yeou that much conserlation; but
doan&#8217;t yeou be sayin&#8217; yeou had any hand in knockin&#8217; him over,
&#8217;cause I don&#8217;t stand fur any foolishness, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked particularly ugly when saying this last, and Thad knew there was
not the slightest shadow of a chance that they would get justice from these
fellows. Seeing the sadly wounded deer plunging blindly toward them, Si had
fired at the animal, and now they claimed to own the prize!</p>

<p>Well, there was no use trying to make a fuss over it; two boys could hardly
expect to overawe three <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span> such hardened woods&#8217; rangers as these.
Nevertheless, for his own satisfaction Thad accepted the rude invitation of Si
Kedge to advance closer, so that he could stand over the deer.</p>

<p>Something caught his eye as he looked, and bending down he deftly took the
object from the motionless body of the deer, just back of the shoulder, where a
patch of blood appeared.</p>

<p>Thad held the object up so that all could see. Even Step Hen recognized it as
the mushroomed bullet that had been fired from his rifle. The evidence was as
positive and clear as noonday; for that bullet, after spreading out, had bored
completely through the body of the buck, and was ready to drop from the other
side when it caught the sharp eye of Thad. And that other wound in the neck must
have been where the boasted large calibre bullet from Si&#8217;s big gun had
gone, producing only a superficial hurt that would not have seriously
inconvenienced the sturdy buck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s my bullet!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, hardly
comprehending what a storm his words might bring about their ears; &#8220;and
just as you said, Thad, I hit him in the side where his heart lies. That would
have killed him in a short time, I just guess, don&#8217;t you, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Thad did not make any answer. He was keeping his eyes on the three men,
even while dropping the spread-out bullet into his pocket to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> show it to Eli and Jim
and Allan when they returned to camp, as proof that the glory of killing the
fine six-pronged buck really belonged to Step Hen.</p>

<p>The giant actually gave a little chuckle. Evidently he admired the nerve
shown by this half-grown lad; for like most big men Cale Martin could on
occasion, exhibit a sense of generosity toward those smaller than himself.</p>

<p>With just that brief chance to see what the three poachers looked like, Thad
was able to size them up along different lines. He believed that Si and Ed were
both shallow brained bullies, with revengeful natures; but that Cale Martin,
while known as a desperate man, was really more so through his association with
such rascals as these, than for any other cause. And Thad chanced to know just
why he had doubly earned this reputation for ugliness during the last year or
so; Jim Hasty&#8217;s running away with his little girl, Lina, had been the last
straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back; since it had made Old Cale feel
reckless, and as though he cared no longer for anything in this world.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye think of that, Si,&#8221; burst out the other fellow,
who had not spoken, up to now; &#8220;the pesky critter is aclaimin&#8217; as
how his friend sent that bullet through ther buck&#8217;s ribs, w&#8217;en we all know
&#8217;twar from yer gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shorter poacher gritted his teeth, and looked <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span> daggers at Thad. He even made a
significant movement with his heavy rifle, which the boy saw was of the
repeating pattern, and had the hammer raised at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doan&#8217;t stand for any sech talk ez that,&#8221; he declared,
with savage energy; &#8220;an&#8217; ef ther cubs knows what is good fur
&#8217;em, they&#8217;ll turn tail, an&#8217; mosey outen this here region some
quick. Scat naow! an&#8217; be mighty keerful haow yeou start tew claimin&#8217;
a deer agin, what another man shot. It&#8217;s sumpin that ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; ter be allowed up here in the woods. I gives yeou fair warnin&#8217;
tew change base, an&#8217; clar out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Thad, let&#8217;s move along!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, who
was white in the face, and trembling more or less.</p>

<p>Of course, the patrol leader was far too smart to think of trying to defy
that ugly lot. At the same time Thad showed no sign of fear as he turned and
gave the bully of the woods one sneering look, as though plainly telling him
what he thought. Indeed, it seemed to stir the ire of the man who claimed to
have killed the deer, for with a snort, he started to throw up his gun, as if
bent on threatening mischief, unless the boys ran in a hurry.</p>

<p>But it was the hand of the giant that grasped the gun, and turned it
aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye try it, Si,&#8221; roared Old Cale. &#8220;We done
enuff as &#8217;tis, atakin&#8217; ther game away from &#8217;em, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span> without layin&#8217; a
hand on ther hides. But ye&#8217;d better skip out, as Si sez, younkers.
An&#8217; say, wile I think o&#8217; it, jest tell thet sneak, Jim Hasty, fur
me, thet I&#8217;m agoin&#8217; ter keep my word &#8217;bout them ears o&#8217;
his&#8217;n. I&#8217;ll larn him what it means ter defy Old Cale Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the life of him Thad could not help making some sort of reply to
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry your message, just as you say,&#8221; he went on;
&#8220;but let me tell you right here and now, you never made a bigger mistake
in your life when you call Jim Hasty a sneak or a coward. Would a coward dare
come up here, when he knew how you hated him, and had it in for him? I guess not
much. Fact is, Jim&#8217;s got a message for you; somebody&#8217;s sent him up
here! And he meant to hunt you up, and see you face to face. A coward! Well, I
guess not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without giving the giant a chance to say another word Thad wheeled,
striding away, with the nervous Step Hen at his side, casting many an anxious
glance back over his shoulder, as though not quite convinced that the warlike Si
might not think it best after all to shoot after them.</p>

<p>But ten minutes later, and the two boys were well away from the spot which
had come very near looking upon a tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel about it now?&#8221; asked Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired the other. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span> &#8220;I&#8217;m as sore as can be
about losing my lovely six-pronged buck, and knocked over all by myself, too.
Wouldn&#8217;t I just like to give it to that low-down liar of a Si Kedge,
though, for saying that was his bullet, when anybody could see that it came from
my rifle? Why, he only pinked the deer in the neck, because I could see the
mark. Oh! the thieves, the miserable skunks, to cheat me out of my prize!
I&#8217;ll never, never get over this, Thad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes you will, Step Hen,&#8221; remarked the other, soothingly, for
he felt that the bare-faced robbery had been a terrible shock to his companion.
&#8220;But what I meant when I asked that, was, do you want to head toward camp
now; have you had enough hunting for to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I know you&#8217;re saying that, Thad, just to let me down
easy,&#8221; declared the other. &#8220;I acknowledge that I was beginning to
get tired, up to the time I killed that deer; but it&#8217;s all passed away
now. The excitement did it for me; and I&#8217;ve got my second wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you want to keep on hunting?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster,
feeling that Step Hen was exhibiting considerable grit under the circumstances,
and delighted to see this same brought out by the ill turn fortune had given
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do,&#8221; instantly replied the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m just
wild to get another chance to knock over a six-pronged buck; and now that I know
the ropes, it&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_106'></a>106</span> easy as falling off a log. Looks like this snow
ain&#8217;t agoing to amount to much, after all; and we&#8217;ve got pretty
nearly half a day ahead of us yet. So let&#8217;s keep on for a while. When I
get a little tired, we&#8217;ll stop to eat our snack of grub, when I can rest
up, and be ready for another hour or two. But I&#8217;m afraid my luck has
turned, and we won&#8217;t sight another deer this blessed day; do you,
Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope to, at any rate,&#8221; replied the other, as he
started off again; &#8220;and it&#8217;s that constant expectation of starting
up game that makes hunting all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. So come along, Step
Hen; and if we fail to bring in our share of venison it won&#8217;t be because
we lay down too easy. Now for quiet again, remember, and keep a constant lookout
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>OVERTAKEN BY DARKNESS.</span></h2>

<p>It must have been a long time after the noon hour when Step Hen did as he had
promised, called a halt in order that they might eat their lunch, and take a
rest.</p>

<p>As the cold was still with them, though the snow had thus far amounted to but
little, Step Hen insisted on starting a small fire, at which they could sit, and
be comfortable, while they devoured the food provided for the midday meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a fire as quick as the next one, Step Hen,&#8221; admitted
Thad, really meaning what he said, and at the same time wishing to raise the
drooping spirits of his hunting mate, who was feeling very sore over the loss of
his game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t pretend to know much about starting a blaze in half
a dozen styles, the way Giraffe&#8217;s got it down pat,&#8221; observed the
other, smiling a little; &#8220;but if you pin me down to going at it the
easiest way, with matches, and dead pine cones, why I&#8217;m there every time.
And say, it does feel some handy, don&#8217;t it, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>They sat there,
and chatted for quite a long time after they had consumed the last morsel of
food. And during that resting spell Step Hen picked up many a crumb of useful
knowledge concerning the ways of the woods. Thad did not know all that Allan
Hollister had learned through practical experience; but he had made the most of
his opportunities when belonging to that other troop of scouts; and never forgot
what he learned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be agoin&#8217; on again,&#8221; remarked Step Hen,
finally, scrambling to his feet, and picking up his little rifle with a new
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel like another spell of it, eh?&#8221; asked the patrol leader,
following suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I do,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;Nothing like
a rest, and a bite, when you&#8217;re pretty near played out. I&#8217;m feeling
fine and dandy again, and ready for several hours&#8217; hard tramping. But
something just seems to tell me we&#8217;ll never again have such a chance to
get a six-pronged buck as that. And to think how it should a been just what the
boys were telling me to knock over. I wonder now&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Thad, as his chum came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;raps you&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m silly if I tell you; but anyhow,
here goes, Thad. It just struck me all of a sudden that we might go back to
where we lost our deer, and do a little trailing on our own account. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span> Them three fellers
wouldn&#8217;t bother trying to hide their tracks, and chances are they&#8217;ve
gone into camp to eat some of that venison by this time, if not
sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad smiled; he could not help it, upon hearing Step Hen talk in this strain;
for only too plainly did he remember how white the other had been, and how even
his voice trembled when he spoke, while facing those three poachers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after we&#8217;ve managed to track them to their camp, what
then?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Step Hen looked wonderfully brave as he instantly replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we might catch &#8217;em off their guard, and hold &#8217;em up.
That deer belongs to <i>me</i>, and I&#8217;d just like to have it the worst
kind, especially that head, with the six-pronged antlers on it. But if you
thought that proposition a little too risky, Thad, why we might conclude to wait
around, keeping under cover, till it got plumb dark. Then we could carry off as
much of the buck as we could tote, including the head; and them fellers not be
any the wiser for it, till it was too late to follow us! How&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad nearly had his breath taken away by the boldness of Step Hen&#8217;s
astonishing proposals. He looked at the other, and a smile spread completely
across his face. Then he puckered up his lips, and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> gave a little whistle, that somehow
caused Step Hen to turn a bit red in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; ejaculated Thad, &#8220;I never before suspected what a
fire-eater you could be, Step Hen. Why, nothing fazes you, nowadays. I believe
you&#8217;d be ready to snap your fingers in the faces of a dozen of the worst
rascals that ever hid up here in the piney woods of Maine. But I&#8217;m afraid
that&#8217;s too risky a job for me to back up, as the leader of the patrol. I
feel the burden of responsibility too much to allow it. What could I say to your
father and mother if there was no Step Hen to answer to the roll-call, when we
mustered out after this Maine hunt? So, on the whole, Step Hen, much as I hate
to disappoint you, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to put a damper on your
scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! all right, Thad,&#8221; quickly remarked the other, with an
evident vein of relief in his voice; &#8220;I was only telling you what came
into my head. You see, that&#8217;s the way with me; I&#8217;m always having
these brilliant plans, though my own good sense won&#8217;t let me try to carry
them out. So we&#8217;ll just continue our old hunt; and hope another buck may
heave in sight. But if one does, please let fly the same time I shoot, Thad;
because we hadn&#8217;t ought to take any chances of his getting away. You will,
won&#8217;t you, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I think I&#8217;m entitled to a shot by now, Step
Hen,&#8221; replied the other; &#8220;seeing that I <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span> held back purposely, so as to let you
have all the glory of getting that first prize. But as you say, we need venison;
and the next time we&#8217;ll shoot together so&#8217;s to make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Then let&#8217;s be moving, Thad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since Step Hen was so set upon doing everything in their power to retrieve
the misfortune that had come upon them earlier in the day, by means of which
they had lost the first deer, Thad meant to try his level best in order to run
across another like prize.</p>

<p>Whenever he saw a piece of ground that looked more than ordinarily promising
he would head that way, regardless of distance or direction. Little Thad cared
as to whether they were able to return to camp that night or not. He had spent
too many nights in the open, not to feel certain that he could manage to be at
least fairly comfortable. And then, too, Thad had the hunter&#8217;s instinct
pretty fully developed, and thought little of fatigue when pursuing his favorite
sport.</p>

<p>They kept moving in this way until the afternoon began to be pretty well
spent. Thad would not think of offering again to head toward the camp on the
shore of the lake, so long as Step Hen made no complaint. He could not afford to
be outdone by a tenderfoot, and he the patrol leader at that.</p>

<p>Indeed, the gray of evening had commenced to spread around them when, with no
more warning <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span> than
before, they came upon a second buck that had possibly been lying down in the
bushes.</p>

<p>The deer sprang away like lightning, and perhaps it was just as well that
Step Hen had asked his companion to shoot with him; for the flitting buck made
rather a difficult target to hit in that poor light.</p>

<p>So close together did the two lads fire that the reports blended, though the
louder bang of the smooth-bore partly drowned the sharper report of the little
repeating rifle.</p>

<p>Thad started to run forward, holding his gun in readiness for a second
discharge, if such were needed. Step Hen trailed along after him, working
desperately with his pump-gun; and like most excitable greenhorns, trying every
which way to work the simple mechanism but the right way, in his eagerness to
get the weapon in serviceable condition again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! <i>did</i> we get him, Thad?&#8221; he cried; for possibly the
smoke of the double discharge had interfered with his vision, and he did not
know whether the deer had dropped, or sped unharmed out of sight, even before
the alert Thad could give him the contents of his second barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;ll have venison for supper to-night,
anyway,&#8221; laughed Thad.</p>

<p>And then, Step Hen, looking more closely ahead, saw a slight movement on the
ground, which he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
realized must be the last expiring kick of their quarry.</p>

<p>His spirits arose at once, and he gave a wild whoop of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully! bully!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he still ran forward after his
chum; &#8220;we did get him all right, didn&#8217;t we, Thad? And I&#8217;d just
like to see any woods&#8217; thief try to hook <i>this</i> deer away from us.
Don&#8217;t you let &#8217;em do it, Thad, will you, even if we have to fight
for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Thad, as they came to a halt over the
fallen buck; &#8220;we&#8217;re not going to have any trouble&#8211;not from
that source, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Step Hen had been less excited he might have noticed that the words of his
companion seemed to admit of their having trouble of another kind; but just then
the tenderfoot was too much wrapped up in other things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s too bad, Thad!&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221; asked the other; &#8220;both of us hit him, all right;
for there&#8217;s the place your bullet went in; and these smaller holes show
where my buckshot struck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look at his antlers, would you, Thad?&#8221; the other went on;
&#8220;why, this is only a two-year-old, I sure reckon, because he&#8217;s got
only two prongs on his horns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well so much the better for us, when we start <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span> to eat him,&#8221; chuckled Thad;
&#8220;because the meat&#8217;ll be just that much more tender, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s get busy, and cut him up, Thad,&#8221; Step Hen went
on. &#8220;Seems to me night&#8217;s coming right along down on us; and the
chances are we&#8217;ll be awful late getting back to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Thad really thought he did not take the trouble to mention; but no doubt
he had long before then made up his mind that they would never make camp that
evening, for he felt that Step Hen must be nearly all in.</p>

<p>He did start to work, however, and with the other to assist in various ways,
managed to get the deer cut up, after a fashion. The meat they expected to carry
with them, together with the head, which Step Hen would not think of leaving
behind, was made up into two packs, so that each of them might carry a fair
portion.</p>

<p>By that time it was pitch dark. Indeed, Step Hen had to kindle another little
fire of dry pine cones in order that the operation of getting the meat secured
might be brought to a finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! just look how dark it is!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, when finally
Thad announced that he was ready to go on, after getting his bearings, which he
did easily by sighting the North star, the clouds having very conveniently
disappeared, and all present danger of a heavy snowfall vanishing with their
going.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>Step Hen was
rather slow and clumsy about getting his load fastened, and Thad had to assist
him. He knew full well what was the matter. The other was really dead tired, and
could hardly put one foot before the other without a great effort. He had been
artificially kept up by the excitement until the game was secured, and now the
reaction was setting in.</p>

<p>They had been slowly moving along for about ten minutes, when from a little
distance away there broke out a strange sound that, heard under those peculiar
conditions, struck Step Hen as more blood-curdling than he had ever thought it
before, when sitting safely in a camp beside a cozy fire, and surrounded by
comrades.</p>

<p>It was that same long-drawn howl of the Canada gray wolf; and as he listened
to a second answering cry from another quarter, somehow Step Hen found himself
shuddering.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>BROUGHT TO BAY BY WOLVES.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Ooh! how awfully queer them howls seem, Thad!&#8221; remarked Step
Hen, presently, just as the patrol leader expected he would; for he had a pretty
good idea as to what was just passing in the mind of the tenderfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they do sound different somehow, from what they did when we were
sitting around the cheery camp-fire, listening to stories told by the
guides,&#8221; Thad admitted. &#8220;But then, wolves as a rule are cowardly
brutes. They may do a heap of howling, but they seldom show any bravery. Only
when in packs are they feared by hunters, away up in the frozen-up parts of
Canada, I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, say, don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s a pack around here,
right now?&#8221; demanded Step Hen, apprehensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you ask that?&#8221; the other questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in the first place, old Eli told us they never came away down
here unless in numbers; and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_117'></a>117</span> then again, Thad, didn&#8217;t you notice that when
one gave tongue over yonder to the right, a second answered him back from the
left; and by jinks! listen to that, would you, a third and a fourth, as sure as
you live! Say, they&#8217;re all around us, Thad; they&#8217;ve got us
surrounded!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em surround, if it does &#8217;em any good,&#8221; laughed
the other; and if he felt the slightest bit of uneasiness himself on account of
those wolfish howls, Thad at least managed to conceal it; because he knew Step
Hen was feeling &#8220;creepy&#8221; enough as it was, without having his alarm
augmented by seeing his companion concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think they might be able to pull us down just by
force of numbers, Thad?&#8221; the other went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there can&#8217;t be any such bunch of the cowardly brutes around,
as all that, I guess, Step Hen. And don&#8217;t forget, please, that we&#8217;re
armed with weapons calculated to knock the spots out of any gray sneak that ever
tried to steal venison won by two husky hunters. Think how you have six bullets
in that little gun of yours; and each one ought to count for a wolf, if it came
to the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there&#8217;s where I was a fool!&#8221; said Step Hen, in a
disgusted tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded his chum, stopping short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never stuck a blessed cartridge in my <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span> pocket, you see. Thought the six I had
in the magazine of the gun would be good and plenty for all the needs I&#8217;d
run up against. Now I wish I had the whole hundred along. Just my luck.
I&#8217;m always losing things, and if it ain&#8217;t anything else, it must be
chances. Think of a hundred dead wolves, and all killed with this great little
gun while I sat perched up in the crotch of a nice tree! It makes me sick to
think of it, that&#8217;s what, Thad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you did put six cartridges in the magazine before we
left?&#8221; asked the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I meant to do, and I reckon I did, all right;
though Giraffe was joking me at the time, and he might have upset my
calculations,&#8221; Step Hen admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, suppose you drop your bundle of meat, and take a
look,&#8221; advised Thad. &#8220;If it gets to warm quarters it&#8217;s just as
well that you know how many wolves you can account for. Throw them out in one,
two, three order, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Step Hen began working the mechanism of his little gun. Not being excited,
he was able to do this excellently. With the first cast a cartridge flew out of
the rejecting opening; but when he tried to repeat, nothing happened. He looked
at the gun blankly, and tried twice more; but with the same result.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; remarked Thad, grimly; &#8220;nothing doing, it seems.
When you <i>thought</i> you put six <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_119'></a>119</span> cartridges in the magazine, you stopped at three.
And just such little mistakes have cost many a hunter his life before now, let
me tell you, Step Hen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mercy, what do you mean, Thad?&#8221; asked the other,
alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, suppose now, several wolves were rushing at you with open mouths;
and when you stood there, feeling able to take care of them all, your gun missed
fire, not because it went back on you, but through your silly fault in not
making sure it was fed to the limit when you started; things would look kind of
gloomy just then, wouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never go out without being dead sure my magazine is plumb
full; and a handful in my pocket besides, catch me again,&#8221; said Step Hen,
solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good resolution to make, and see to it that you
remember it. But all the same, my boy, it isn&#8217;t helping us any just now.
You&#8217;ve got one bullet, and I advise you to hang on to that to the bitter
end. Let me do most of the shooting, if it ever comes to it, which I hope it
won&#8217;t; because I&#8217;ve got a belt full of all sorts of shells, from
buckshot to Number Sevens. Now, shall we go on again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Step Hen, cheerfully.</p>

<p>But when he had managed to get his arms through the loops of his bundle, and
began to heave it up on his back, he groaned audibly, so that Thad knew full
well they would hardly make camp that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_120'></a>120</span> night, at least not without several rests by the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far d&#8217;ye think it is, Thad?&#8221; asked Step Hen a few
minutes later, as he dragged along behind the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t just tell,&#8221; replied Thad. &#8220;It may be
only three miles, and then again perhaps it would tally up twice that.
We&#8217;re going to strike the lake shore by keeping on as we are; but just how
far away from camp, gets me. Like as not we can sight their fire, and give the
boys a hail that will fetch a canoe for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee! wish that blessed canoe was here right now,&#8221; murmured poor
Step Hen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty near at the end of your rope, ain&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I acknowledge the corn, Thad. I never was so dead
tired in all my life. But I&#8217;ve still got the grit to keep along as far as
I c&#8217;n put one foot in front of the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you; we&#8217;ll try it a little further, and see,&#8221;
Thad went on.</p>

<p>He was chuckling to himself even while he spoke; for he knew full well that,
although it pleased the tenderfoot to call it &#8220;grit,&#8221; in truth it
was fear of those lurking, howling wolves that was driving Step Hen to making
these astonishing efforts. After all there is absolutely nothing like fear to
make a laggard run like a Marathon sprinter. It has even <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span> effected cures in people supposed to be
paralyzed, as Thad remembered reading not a great while before.</p>

<p>They continued on for some time longer; but from the increasing puffing and
grunting that came from the region where Step Hen was staggering along, it was
evident that he was about ready to give up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thad!&#8221; he gasped, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what is it, Step Hen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a tree,&#8221; remarked the other; &#8220;I mean one
that&#8217;s got limbs near the ground, and not like these other tall ghostly
pines that I&#8217;d need a lineman&#8217;s spurs to shin up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad stopped for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can&#8217;t walk on any further, Step Hen, say so, and
I&#8217;ll get up something that ought to keep the wolves away; but of course,
if you&#8217;re ready to call quits, why I suppose we&#8217;ll have to climb up
here, and squat like a couple of owls all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prospect evidently did not please Step Hen any too well; besides, he
still retained a shred of his former pride. So he bristled up as he made answer,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course I c&#8217;n go on for quite a distance yet, if you think
there&#8217;s any use of it, Thad. Now, what was you agoin&#8217; to do, you
said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under this pine tree, you see, that&#8217;s been badly <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span> used in some storm,
there are a lot of branches lying. We can knock off a couple of the ones that
look like they might burn pretty well, and use &#8217;em for torches.
Let&#8217;s get busy and see if it&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any rate it gave Step Hen another chance to rest up, and get his breath.
He still clung to that heavy deer&#8217;s head with its antlers. Step Hen could
be a most obstinate fellow when he chose; and having once made up his mind, it
was like trying to move the rock of Gibraltar to change it.</p>

<p>After considerable effort, and the wasting of many matches, so as to get the
pine cones and needles started into a blaze, on account of the night wind that
kept blowing them out as fast as Step Hen lighted them, the torches were finally
made an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wave it around some more, and the wind is going to keep it
going,&#8221; advised Thad; &#8220;besides, the swinging motion will warn the
wolves to keep away, if they don&#8217;t want to get their old hides singed.
Now, if you&#8217;re feeling fit, we&#8217;ll make another stab at getting over
the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Thad knew they would not go far before something else would happen; and
he really expected that sooner or later they would have to do battle with the
hungry four-footed denizens of the pine woods that had scented their fresh meat,
and gave signs of meaning to possess some of it, no matter at what cost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>So Thad bent his
mind on figuring out what they had better do if it came down to a halt. He knew
that once they went into camp they could build several fires, so as to virtually
surround themselves with a circle of flames, across which no wolf that ever
lived would have the daring to jump. And consequently Thad did not feel so
deeply concerned about how things would come out as his comrade did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that and wasn&#8217;t it a nasty snarl, though?&#8221;
demanded Step Hen after possibly five minutes more had passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard it, and I suppose the beasts are closing in now,&#8221;
Thad replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Closing in! Oh! my gracious! Thad, we had ought to be finding a good
tree like that Jim dandy one I wanted to climb, when you said no. These torches
ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to last much longer; and I don&#8217;t believe the
critters care about &#8217;em anyway. Hadn&#8217;t we better change the
programme, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one thing I object to,&#8221; the other answered; &#8220;after
going to all this trouble to get venison, and losing our first deer to those
woods&#8217; pirates, I don&#8217;t feel like letting these measly wolves share
in this second lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s my sentiments exactly, Thad; but tell me how we&#8217;re
agoin&#8217; to prevent &#8217;em, won&#8217;t you? If it comes right down to
brass tacks we&#8217;ve just got to think of saving our own lives, first of all,
and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span> let the
precious meat go. But then, if we found a tree, we might hang it up before
climbing among the branches ourselves. Then, while they were jumping, and trying
to snatch it down, we could be peppering the bunch like fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it to me, Step Hen; I&#8217;ve got a plan worth two of that;
though we might as well stop under this tree to try out; and if it comes to the
worst we can climb up. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be necessary.
Throw down your bundle, now, and get busy. We&#8217;re going to have a fire,
two, three of &#8217;em; and squatting in the middle of the string, we&#8217;ll
just cook us some of this tender young buck, and snap our fingers at Mr. Wolf.
If he gets too brash, why, we&#8217;ll give him a card with our compliments.
Hurry up, and get a fire going, while I stand guard over you, Step
Hen.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIRE CIRCLE.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me, all right, Thad; I&#8217;ll have a spark going the
quickest ever, if that old wind only holds up a bit. Here&#8217;s aplenty of
loose stuff, to begin with, that I can kick together. Wait till I stick my torch
in this crotch of the tree. Just as well to have some light to work by,&#8221;
and as he kept up this running fire of talk, Step Hen was busying himself right
swiftly.</p>

<p>For the moment he forgot all his aches and pains, and worked like a Trojan;
indeed, no defender of ancient Troy ever had more urgent reason for getting
things going than Step Hen thought he did just at that minute.</p>

<p>He used his feet and hands to gather the loose pine needles in a heap; and
when he thought he had things fixed to suit him, the next business that engaged
his attention was getting the pile to take fire. After that Step Hen said he
would be &#8220;on Easy Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this while the night wind had been moaning <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> and whistling through the tops of the
tall pines, making a mournful kind of music, calculated to add to the uneasiness
caused by the savage howls of the hungry wolves from the north. But Step Hen had
learned a lesson while lighting his torch, and knew that the wind came in gusts,
with short intervals between. By waiting a few seconds after it had started to
blow at quite a lively rate, he was able to find a lull; and making the most of
his opportunity, he hastily struck his match, and applied it to the dry stuff he
had made sure to keep underneath.</p>

<p>But after all he came very near spoiling it; for just at that very second
there was a loud howl, so close at hand that Step Hen was impelled to look over
his shoulder, under the impression that the wolf pack was even then about to
overwhelm him while he bent down, almost defenseless, above the pile of dry
stuff.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right; don&#8217;t worry!&#8221; exclaimed Thad, who
was standing guard, with his faithful Marlin gripped tight in his hands; and any
wolf that attempted to try conclusions with that reliable little gun would
surely regret his temerity.</p>

<p>The flame managed to catch before the wind could come back again to blow it
out; and once the connection had been made, the draught only served to make the
fire burn the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that&#8217;s done; and now what?&#8221; asked <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span> Step Hen, whirling
around to pick up his own weapon, under the belief that he would feel easier in
his mind if in a position to defend himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to extend the fire belt, and make several more like
the one you&#8217;ve got going,&#8221; replied Thad, laying his gun down, so
that he might busy himself. &#8220;Here are plenty of branches, and all sorts of
good burning stuff. If only Giraffe were with us now, wouldn&#8217;t he be in
his glory, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Step Hen, slowly; &#8220;he might; and again,
perhaps Giraffe don&#8217;t like wolves any better than I do. And he gets so
rattled too, whenever he&#8217;s nervous. I try to take things as cool as
anything. What&#8217;s the use getting excited, when it ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217;
to help a single bit. And I know you&#8217;ll say the same, eh, Thad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never spoke truer words, Step Hen,&#8221; replied the scoutmaster,
gravely; and yet secretly he was shaking with laughter, because everybody knew
that Step Hen was the worst offender in that line the patrol boasted; so that it
seemed almost as &#8220;good as a circus,&#8221; Thad afterwards declared, to
hear him talk in this way.</p>

<p>They worked diligently, and soon managed to not only extend the fire so as to
take in three more points, and thus completely surround the spot where they had
dumped the packs of venison; but to secure quite a supply of fuel besides, with
which to feed the flames from time to time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>&#8220;Now
what?&#8221; again demanded Step Hen, when he saw that his companion meant to
call a halt upon these proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper is the next thing on the programme,&#8221; observed Thad.
&#8220;I feel just like enjoying some of that same venison. It will not only
make us feel stronger, but considerably lighten our loads when we take a notion
to go on again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me in on that deal; because, honest Injun now, I&#8217;m that
empty my stomach feels like it wanted to shake hands with my backbone. Say, this
must be a real hunter&#8217;s feast, Thad. I never went through such an
experience as this before. And just listen to the nerve of them rascals,
ahowlin&#8217; themselves hoarse, just because we object to sharing our grub
pile with &#8217;em. D&#8217;ye suppose, now, we&#8217;ll have to knock over a
few of the pesky varmints, as old Eli calls &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be one bit surprised,&#8221; replied Thad; and the
other noticed that he did not move in the least without making sure that his gun
was within reach; from which it was evident that Thad had no intention of being
caught unprepared, should the hungry wolves make a sudden dash.</p>

<p>Of course Step Hen was next to totally ignorant as to how to cook meat
without the frying-pan to which he had been accustomed. And he watched just how
Thad did it, closely imitating him.</p>

<p>Taking a stout and fairly long sliver of wood, a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span> small piece of the meat was secured to
one end, after which the other point was thrust into the ground in such a
position that the meat came pretty near a place where the embers burned red, and
glowed invitingly. Presently the heat began to make the meat sizzle, and then it
slowly cooked, turning a delightful brown color, and sending out odors that made
the boys fairly shiver with eagerness to start eating.</p>

<p>When one piece was considered done, it was quickly eaten by a hungry hunter,
and its place taken with a fresh supply.</p>

<p>So the good work went on. Both boys were ravenously hungry, and only small
bits could be cooked this way at a time, so that it was pretty much a whole hour
before they had fully satisfied their clamorous appetites. And although the meal
had been eaten under the strangest conditions of any which he could remember,
Step Hen was ready to declare he had enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re gettin&#8217; madder and madder all the while, just
because we didn&#8217;t send &#8217;em an invite to our little feast!&#8221;
declared Step Hen. &#8220;Just listen to the critters yawp, would you, Thad?
They&#8217;re buttin&#8217; in closer and closer, a foot at a time. And honest
now, I reckon there must be all the way from half a dozen to ten thousand of
&#8217;em around us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty good and safe range,&#8221; laughed the patrol
leader; &#8220;and I guess you&#8217;ve covered the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span> ground, all right. There are surely
half a dozen of &#8217;em, and how many more I wouldn&#8217;t like to say,
because I don&#8217;t know just how much noise one old wolf can kick up. But
don&#8217;t they sing sweetly, though? Shall we be generous, and throw them out
the balance of the venison, to show them how we like their song?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say, not any,&#8221; returned Step Hen, after giving
his companion a quick glance, as if to see whether he really meant it, or was
only joking. &#8220;We had too much hard work getting our supply to throw it to
the dogs. Let the lazy curs run along, and find some for themselves. Besides,
it&#8217;s too good to think of wasting it. I want the rest of the fellers to
taste <i>our</i> venison. Mine went glimmering, and I hope it half choked that
villainous crowd. Anyway you vowed it was a whole lot tougher than this haunch;
and there&#8217;s that comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was evident that if the hungry animals around heard this decision they
refused to pay any attention to it; for instead of decreasing, the howls
actually became louder and more insistent, until finally Thad picked up his
gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to see that we&#8217;re going to have a little target practice
after all, Step Hen,&#8221; he remarked, quietly. &#8220;When things get so bad
that you can see the skulking beasts creeping about your camp, and even catch
the glitter of their yellow eyes, it&#8217;s nearly <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span> time to begin to bowl a few of them
over, so as to inform the rest that we&#8217;ve got a dead line marked around
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221; answered Step Hen, in an awed tone;
&#8220;show me one, Thad, please. I&#8217;d just like to say I&#8217;d seen a
wolf, really and truly, for once in my life, outside of a menagerie or a
circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; replied the other; &#8220;just follow the line
of my finger, and I give you my word that skulking thing in the shadows is a
real genuine, Canada wolf. I&#8217;m going to prove it to you in a minute or
two, by taking a crack at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! now there&#8217;s two of &#8217;em, Thad, crossing each
other&#8217;s trail. And see there, if that ain&#8217;t a third, and even a
fourth. Why, I believe the woods are full of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re about right,&#8221; replied the patrol leader, more
seriously than before, the alarmed Step Hen thought. &#8220;Here, let&#8217;s
throw a few blazing brands around, to scare &#8217;em off some, while we lift
the bundles up among the branches of this tree. Then, if anything should force
us to take refuge there, at any rate we wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to the
plaguey things chewing at our grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was accordingly done. When the burning bits of wood were hurled out
toward them, the wolves temporarily retreated; but Thad knew full well they
would soon crowd back, drawn by the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_132'></a>132</span> scent of the fresh meat; and besides, he did not
like to take the chances of setting the woods afire; just after he, and the
balance of the Silver Fox Patrol, had accepted this new test of their abilities
in the line of doing a good act as fire wardens.</p>

<p>The two packages of venison were easily hoisted into the tree, Step Hen
readily climbing up himself in order to lift them still higher; so that by no
possibility could a leaping wolf manage to get his teeth in either bundle.</p>

<p>Step Hen came down again a little unwillingly, Thad saw. It must have seemed
good and safe up there, so far removed from the fangs of the encircling wolves;
but after the fires had burned completely out, it would prove a pretty cold
perch; and for one the young scoutmaster did not yearn to try it, unless every
other resort failed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch what happens!&#8221; remarked Thad, as the other joined him
again, gun in hand; &#8220;and remember, only shoot if you have to. I&#8217;ll
hold one barrel in reserve all the time. After I shoot you&#8217;ll see me get a
new shell in the chamber as quick as I can work it. Be ready, now; and watch
sharp!&#8221;</p>

<p>No need to tell Step Hen that. He was already keyed up to top-notch condition
by the excitement that caused his nerves to quiver, and his breath to come in
gasps. And yet, if any one had accused the boy of being afraid, he would have at
once indignantly denied the imputation. Perhaps he was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> holding himself sternly in hand; Thad
hoped as much; but then some persons have a queer way of showing that they are
cool and collected. Step Hen was one, for instance; but if all of us could
realize just how we look to our neighbors, we might not feel quite so proud.</p>

<p>Thad had his gun ready for quick work. He only waited until he could glimpse
one of those skulking, shadowy forms on the outside border of the light cast by
the fire circle. Then he glanced along the barrels of his gun, though instinct
enabled him to cover the target better than all this aiming; after which his
finger pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>The boom of the gun was instantly succeeded by a series of alarming howls;
and then Step Hen was heard shouting exultantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You got him then, Thad! I saw him turn a back somersault. He&#8217;s a
dead one, all right, I tell you, whoop!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>STEP HEN HAS VISIONS OF A FUR COAT.</span></h2>

<p>Thad was already hastily inserting a fresh shell in the left chamber of his
little shotgun. He felt fully satisfied that he had done just what Step Hen so
vociferously proclaimed, knocked over one of the skulking wolves; but there were
more of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span> same
breed around, and presently they would get over the temporary fright caused by
the flash of fire, together with the heavy crash, when possibly they might show
themselves bolder than ever.</p>

<p>And like a true Boy Scout, Thad Brewster believed in always being prepared.
He had really taken that for his motto long before he thought of joining a troop
of the scouts; so that much of what he agreed to do when signing the muster
roll, lay directly in a line with his own ideas of what a wide-awake boy should
be.</p>

<p>&#8220;They backed off after that hot reception, Thad,&#8221; Step Hen went
on. &#8220;Oh! I hope I&#8217;ll get a chance to pop over just one of the sneaky
beasts. I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;d shot a real wolf. Think of me, Step Hen
Bingham, who up to a year ago had never gone off camping or hunting, with a bear
to my credit, a buck actually knocked over, even if it was stole away from me;
and now, as the crowning event of all, I want to get a savage wolf, a real
Canada wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Thad, laughingly; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that
they&#8217;re different from any other kind they have out on the plains; though
perhaps they may be a little larger, and ready to attack a man quicker. But
perhaps you&#8217;d better take the next good chance then, Step Hen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I, Thad? That&#8217;s kind of you. Suppose you give me pointers,
then, and tell me just when to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_135'></a>135</span> blaze away. I want to make a dead sure thing of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the wolf, you mean, I guess,&#8221; Thad went on, keeping a bright
lookout while he talked. &#8220;Well, watch that place where I got my fellow,
and I think you&#8217;ll soon see something moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must mean the rest will be wanting to make a supper off the
critter you killed; is that it, Thad? Are they such cannibals as all
that?&#8221; asked Step Hen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always said to be,&#8221; the patrol leader returned, and then quickly
added. &#8220;Keep on the lookout, and if you see anything moving, tell me.
Above all don&#8217;t waste ammunition by firing recklessly. We&#8217;re not
trying to scare &#8217;em off by noise; every shot ought to count for a
wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>They lapsed into silence for some little time, during which both boys used
their eyes to the best advantage. Several times Step Hen&#8217;s eagerness
caused him to imagine he had caught a glimpse of a moving object; but upon
calling the attention of his more experienced comrade to the spot, in every
instance Thad had pronounced it a false alarm.</p>

<p>But in the end there came a time when Thad himself saw something move, and as
he watched more closely he made positive that it was another wolf creeping up in
the direction of the spot where his first victim probably lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all ready, Step Hen?&#8221; he asked, quietly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8220;Just try
me, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; came the whispered reply, as the other scout
clutched his rifle nervously, and strained his eyes to see what had caught the
attention of his chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then watch that spot where my game kicked the bucket; one of his mates
is right now coming to drag the body away, to give it a wolf burial. See him,
Step Hen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, and be sure and tell me just when to let him have it,
Thad,&#8221; replied the other, beginning to cover the indistinct moving figure
with his ready gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, hold on for a bit,&#8221; Thad cautioned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to give the fire here a kick that will make it spring up. Then, when you can be
sure you&#8217;re getting a bead on the slinker, give him Hail Columbia. Watch
out, now, old fellow. It&#8217;s going to be your only chance to bag a genuine
wolf from the Canada bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as Thad had said, the fire burned briskly after he had used the toe of
his boot to give it new life; and sure enough, Step Hen could see the outlines
of a long, dim figure that seemed to be hugging the ground. He could even catch
the odd gleam of the wicked yellow eyes that were doubtless watching their every
movement.</p>

<p>With the sharp report of his rifle there was another howl, this time of
pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>&#8220;Did I get
him, Thad?&#8221; cried the marksman, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hit him, that&#8217;s certain, because I saw him flop over,&#8221;
replied the other; &#8220;and that yelp meant sudden pain, as sure as it stood
for anything. But he managed to get off, though possibly he will fall within
twenty feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s too bad, because his chums&#8217;ll chew him all up,
and I&#8217;ll never have my nice wolf-skin to get a coat made out of for
winter,&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen; and then, as he was seized by a new thought,
he went on: &#8220;But Thad, suppose I took a torch and went out there,
d&#8217;ye think I&#8217;d be apt to find him lying on his back? I&#8217;d like
the worst kind to get hold of him before the rest of the bunch muster up courage
enough to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you haven&#8217;t even a load in your gun, that would be
too risky a game for you to play, Step Hen, and just for an old wolf-skin at
that. Perhaps we&#8217;ve given &#8217;em such a bad scare now that the rest of
the pack may skip out, and leave us in peace. Then in the morning you&#8217;d
find your chap, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen! there&#8217;s something crashing through the bushes right back
of us, Thad!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, a minute later, though his companion
knew it before he spoke. &#8220;Sounds like an elephant might be coming down on
us; but they don&#8217;t have such animals up here in the Maine woods, do they?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> Just hear the
racket he keeps making Thad; whatever do you suppose we&#8217;re up against
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a two-legged elephant, then, Step Hen,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;Fact is, we&#8217;re going to have company, for that&#8217;s a
man pushing through the brush, and making all the noise he can, so as to scare
the wolves away, and at the same time keep us from firing on him.&#8221; Then
raising his voice, Thad called out: &#8220;Hello, there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet you, Thad?&#8221; came an answering call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! it&#8217;s Old Eli!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, readily
recognizing the voice of the guide. &#8220;This way, Eli; we&#8217;re having a
healthy old time knocking over some of your Canada wolves. Each got one so far,
but I reckon the rest of the pack must a lit out when they heard you coming. I
see you now, Eli; and mighty glad you dropped in on us. Where did you spring
from anyway; don&#8217;t tell me we&#8217;re as near the camp as
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli came up, with a wide grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! camp about mile and a half down lake,&#8221; he remarked, as he
gravely shook hands with each hunter in turn. &#8220;We saw light of fire over
point, and think it might be you boys; so I paddled canoe across here. It
ain&#8217;t jest five minits walk &#8217;cross this strip ter the lake. So ye got sum
o&#8217; the critters, did ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thad, can&#8217;t we look up that one I shot now; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span> I&#8217;d just hate to lose him, you
know?&#8221; begged Step Hen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose it would be safe for all of us to go out,&#8221;
returned the patrol leader. &#8220;Here, pick up something that will burn, and
come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found Thad&#8217;s victim without any trouble, but the second one was
not within range of the light from their torches. But poor anxious Step Hen
begged so piteously to be allowed to extend the search &#8220;just a little
further,&#8221; that Thad did not have the heart to say no. And a minute later,
after they had gone forward twice as far as Thad had at first intended, Step Hen
gave a gurgling cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looky there, Thad, what&#8217;s that thing lying over yonder? Seems to
me mighty like a dead one. Yes, sir, that&#8217;s what it is, as sure as
I&#8217;m Step Hen Bingham. Oh! how terrible he looks, even when stretched out
there, and gone up the flue. <i>My</i> wolf, too. What a fine coat he&#8217;s
got, and as gray as they make &#8217;em. Say, won&#8217;t I just cut a swell
when I wear that out in a sleigh with Sue Baker; and every time she rubs the
sleeve she&#8217;ll say: &#8216;And just to think that <i>you</i> shot this savage old
wolf all by yourself, Step Hen; oh! what a brave fellow you
are!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a second dead wolf, sure enough. The little repeating rifle had, as
usual, given a good account of itself, and the stricken beast had only <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> been able to drag
himself a little distance away, before giving up.</p>

<p>Both animals were dragged over to the fires, and then Eli set to work taking
off the skins with a rapidity that told of long experience along the trapping
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use aluggin&#8217; these critters over ter the canoe, and then ter
camp,&#8221; Eli had announced. &#8220;Ther two skins&#8217;ll make a purty good
coat, I guess naow. An&#8217; so ye gut a pack o&#8217; prime venison to tote
home as well, hev ye? Thet&#8217;s good. My mouth&#8217;s jes&#8217; made up fur
a steak; an&#8217; the boys&#8217;ll feel tickled ter death when they sees
yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Step Hen was a little nervous at leaving the fire zone, especially since Eli
and Thad insisted on putting out every spark before departing, according to the
law of the State; but then he managed to carry one torch, and with that to serve
them, they took up their line of march.</p>

<p>It was not so very far to the edge of the lake. Thad laughed, and said the
joke was on him; because, when they halted he really believed they were a couple
of miles away from water. If he had known the shore was so near by he would have
managed to coax the tired Step Hen to trudge on just a little further, so as to
camp with the water covering one side, and bringing that much security; not to
speak of the chances for signaling to the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_141'></a>141</span> home camp by means of the code which he and Allan,
as Boy Scouts, understood.</p>

<p>But it was all right now, and Step Hen felt quite merry over the chance of
being taken comfortably to the camp by means of the canoe.</p>

<p>Eli did the paddling, and the two weary lads just snuggled down in the boat,
feeling that they had had a great day of it, all told. The presence of the
venison, as well as the wolf-skins, would be positive proof as to the
reliability of their astonishing story; should there be any skeptic around. And
then Thad had the wonderful mushroomed bullet that had killed that six-pronged
buck; so that as they narrated the first adventure that had come their way, they
could produce evidence to back up the story.</p>

<p>Their coming was greeted by more or less enthusiasm, although the boys had
evidently been coached by Allan not to be too vociferous, as they were in a
country where timid game abounded, and it was poor policy to frighten away the
quarry they had come so far to secure.</p>

<p>Step Hen forgot all his weariness as he found himself being shaken by the
hand again and again, while he and Thad told the tale of their day&#8217;s
outing. It was nice to play the hero part once in a while, and more than ever
did Step Hen feel that life had become more worth living than ever, since he
joined the Cranford troop of Boy Scouts. But <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_142'></a>142</span> for that he would never have discovered what
splendid things there were to be met with in the great forests; and the spirit
of the hunter and the fisherman, which had lain dormant in his nature, might
never have been awakened.</p>

<p>And while the hour was rather late, all of the boys insisted on tasting a
small piece of the deer meat brought in by the two successful Nimrods.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FOX FARMER.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is the greatest venison I ever tasted!&#8221; declared
Bumpus, after he had disposed of his share, and sighed to think that the rules
of the game debarred him from having a second piece; because they had had a
bumper supper only a few hours before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just dandy!&#8221; added Giraffe, who was in the same class as his fat
campmate, and would have been only too glad for an invitation to &#8220;cut, and
come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Step Hen, suddenly, &#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ve
got to congratulate you, Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Er, what d&#8217;ye mean, Step Hen?&#8221; replied the tall scout,
at the same time beginning to look a trifle confused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;Why, you
know you told us we&#8217;d be <i>surprised</i> when we got back,&#8221; the
other went on to say, a little maliciously; &#8220;and I reckon you&#8217;ve
gone and done it at last; and now you&#8217;re ready to show us just how easy it
works.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus could not refrain for the life of him from giving a sarcastic chuckle,
which of course added to the evident embarrassment of Giraffe; who, however
assumed a serious air upon making his reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8211;er&#8211;not exactly, Step Hen. I&#8217;ve got her
figgered out all right, in my mind, so that in the morning I c&#8217;n go ahead, and
work out the details. I calculate a short half hour ought to see me wind up in
just a blaze of glory. But just yet it&#8217;s a toss-up who the
ice-cream&#8217;s going to be on, Bumpus or me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I ain&#8217;t worrying even a little mite,&#8221; asserted the
confident Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you wait and see!&#8221; declared Giraffe, defiantly. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t all know what I&#8217;ve got up my sleeve. The feller that laughs
last laughs loudest, they say. And I give you all fair warning that&#8217;s
going to be me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Thad managed to get in close touch with Jim Hasty. When the others
were joking, and having a merry time, he was wondering how the guide&#8217;s
little affair had been working out.</p>

<p>Many hours had passed since he had seen Jim, and he wondered whether the
latter could have had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_144'></a>144</span> any further communication from Old Cale, or even
run across the father of his wife in the pine woods.</p>

<p>Jim was looking a little more serious than ever; but so far as Thad could
discover there was nothing about him to indicate that he had been in violent
collision with an enemy. And there were both his ears in their proper places;
which fact might be taken as positive proof that the giant poacher had at least
so far not attempted to carry out his terrible threat.</p>

<p>Jim seemed to know what was passing through the boy&#8217;s mind; for he
smiled faintly, and shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing new happened, then, Jim?&#8221; questioned the patrol
leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw. I hain&#8217;t been far from camp the hull blessed day; an&#8217;
consequently never had no chanct tew run up against Pa Martin,&#8221; replied
the other. &#8220;But I&#8217;m more sot than ever tew see him face tew face,
afore I quits this here region. It&#8217;s jest <i>gut</i> tew be done, else I
wudn&#8217;t hev ther nerve tew face Little Lina agin. She made me promise;
an&#8217; by thunder! nawthin&#8217; hain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; tew skeer me off.
If he doan&#8217;t hunt me out, by ding! I&#8217;ll take a turn at hit,
an&#8217; find Cale Martin myself, ef so be I gotter tramp all the way tew his
shack, wich I knows on&#8217;y tew well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, Jim!&#8221; said Thad, admiringly; &#8220;but I suppose
you understand what risk you&#8217;re <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span> taking in trying that game? From all I&#8217;ve
heard about Cale Martin, he&#8217;s surely a terror; and then the threat he made
about your ears would be enough to scare most men away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim drew a long breath as he answered this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lot&#8217;s o&#8217; people doan&#8217;t know Ole Cale like I does. He
hain&#8217;t so black nor they jes&#8217; paints him. Them game wardens is
afeerd o&#8217; him, and they piles all kinds o&#8217; things on his shoulders
thet he hain&#8217;t no business to kerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard before about giving a dog a bad name, and then
he has to bear the sins of the whole neighborhood,&#8221; remarked Thad.
&#8220;There is never a sheep killed but that Dog Tray is the guilty one. And so
you think Cale isn&#8217;t altogether so bad as we&#8217;ve heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a big man, and he&#8217;s gut an&#8217; <i>orful</i>
temper; but it&#8217;s them tew critters he goes with thet&#8217;s the wust
cases. They jest draw him inter slick games, Cale, he&#8217;d never think
o&#8217; tryin&#8217;, left by hisself. But we heerd as haow he&#8217;s struck a
new thing, if so be he on&#8217;y knows enuff ter keep it agoin&#8217;, an&#8217;
shakes them other fellers. An&#8217; if anybody kin make a success o&#8217; fox
raisin&#8217;, I jest guess Cale is ther man, &#8217;cause he knows all erbout the
slick little varmints from A ter Z.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fox raising?&#8221; exclaimed Thad, at once deeply interested.
&#8220;Tell me about that, Jim. Seems like it ought to be worth while listening
to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jim, apparently only too
well pleased to say something in favor of the big and reckless parent of his
little wife; &#8220;yer see, thar&#8217;s a company as hes been formed away
daown in Bosting, tew raise foxes o&#8217; all kinds, jest tew git the pelts. I
s&#8217;pose yew knows as haow them skins air agittin&#8217; more valerable every
blessed year. More people tew wear furs, an&#8217; less animals tew give
&#8217;em. Why, thar was twelve hundred dollars paid fur a black fox pelt jest
last Spring; an&#8217; I seen the check with my own eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Thad went on, deeply interested. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
understood that tremendous prices were being paid out for that scarce skin; but
is Cale meaning to try and raise black or silver foxes for the market? I was
told by several people that they considered the silver fox only a freak, and
that they would never breed true to species. How about that, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve allers hed an ijee thet way myself,&#8221; returned the
short guide, scratching his head in a reflective manner; &#8220;but Cale, he
thinks the other way; an&#8217; Cale, he sure knows more about foxes in a day
than I wud in a year. Wall, we done heard as haow he hed made a contrack with
this company fur a number o&#8217; years, tew act as manager o&#8217; ther farm.
It&#8217;s in another part o&#8217; ther State; an&#8217; when Cale, he leaves
here arter a leetle while, he never &#8217;spects tew come back again. Wouldn&#8217;t
be surprised naow if he hed a few foxes over tew ther <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span> old shack as he means tew kerry away
with him when he quits up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you suppose he&#8217;ll stick to those two tough characters,
and keep them with him in his new job? Won&#8217; they queer his game with the
company, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I doan&#8217;t know, of course, what his plans be, but Cale,
he&#8217;s a great feller tew keep his word; an&#8217; if so be he&#8217;s told
this company as he&#8217;ll run things straight jest believe me they ain&#8217;t
agoin&#8217; tew be no place for them two poachers around <i>his</i> fox farm.
He&#8217;d run &#8217;em off with his gun mighty quick. Yes, Cale keeps his
word; an&#8217; thet&#8217;s what makes me a leetle bit shy &#8217;bout
bein&#8217; able tew convince him tew leave my ears whar they belongs. But Lina,
bless her, sez as haow he jest cain&#8217;t hold aout, when he hears what I
gotter tell him; an&#8217; Lina, she orter know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad admired the man more than ever. Just because of his faith in Lina, here
was Jim ready to put his head in the lion&#8217;s mouth, so to speak. Thad
suspected that he might be carrying some very important intelligence to the
bearded giant of the pine woods; but whatever it was, Jim did not take the
trouble to enlighten him; and Thad did not really think he had any business to
ask.</p>

<p>After that Jim seemed to lapse into silence, and seeing that he did not
appear anxious to continue the talk along lines that concerned his personal
matters, the scoutmaster turned to the others again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>The hour was now
getting rather late, and while those who had remained in camp during much of the
day might not be unusually tired, Step Hen gave signs of falling asleep by the
fire. Several times his head gave a lurch to one side, so that presently Giraffe
caught him roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, d&#8217;ye want to take a header square into the blaze, Step
Hen?&#8221; he demanded, as the other opened his eyes, and looked sleepily at
him. &#8220;I like fires as well as anybody, but excuse me from getting roasted
in one. Don&#8217;t you think he ought to be sent to bed, Mr. Scoutmaster?
He&#8217;s so logy right now, that the chances are ten to one he&#8217;ll climb
in, and wrap the blanket around his head instead of his feet. Seems like
you&#8217;ll have to appoint a dry-nurse to look after the poor baby, or else he
may freeze to death in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Step Hen did not wait for any permission to retire. He just crept away,
and vanished under the folds of the second tent, which he shared with Thad and
Davy Jones.</p>

<p>Indeed, the others were that sleepy they declared they would not be long in
following his example. Thad himself was the first to get up and stretch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s late, fellows, and we ought to be turning in, if we want to
be good for anything to-morrow. And remember, that if this sort of thing keeps
up, we&#8217;re going to change the programme, and let every scout have a share
in keeping sentry duty, working <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_149'></a>149</span> in couples. It doesn&#8217;t seem exactly fair that
when Eli and Jim have to work all day with the paddles, or in any other way,
they ought to spend half the night standing guard. Hello! there&#8217;s Eli
right now, coming in on the trot, as if he had some news for us. What&#8217;s
up, Eli?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old guide had been down to the shore of the lake to take a look at the
canoes; and he was plainly bringing some sort of news, if they could judge from
his hasty steps; and the look of concern on his dark face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Canoe comin&#8217; along daown yonder; mout be Cale&#8217;s
agoin&#8217; ter pay us a visit,&#8221; he remarked; and his words aroused the
sleepy boys as thoroughly as though they had been ducked with a bucket of
ice-water.</p>

<p>They all hastened to step off toward the shore. Bumpus even picked up his
gun, possibly under the belief that there might be a speck of war on the
horizon. Jim looked a trifle uneasy, but there was a grimness in the way he shut
his jaws together that told of his set purpose to face the music somehow or
other, before leaving this country of the Eagle Lakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it comes!&#8221; announced Giraffe, in a half whisper, as he
pointed to the left.</p>

<p>They could soon all make out the dim, shadowy canoe that was stealing along,
some little distance from the shore, and evidently bent on passing the camp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;I kin
jest make out two fellers in her,&#8221; said Eli, who had sharp eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon one of them must be Old Cale, then; he seems to be
shadin&#8217; his eyes with his hand, alookin&#8217; toward our fire, and us
astandin&#8217; here,&#8221; Giraffe went on to say, though no one could be
really positive, because the light was so poor.</p>

<p>The canoe passed by in this spectral fashion. There was no hail from those
who sat in the boat, one using the paddle with the usual dexterity of a Maine
guide; and of course none of the scouts thought of calling out, knowing who and
what the voyagers were.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that was Old Cale in the bow?&#8221; remarked Thad, after
the canoe had faded away.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he was alookin&#8217; fur me, I kinder guess,&#8221; said
Jim, mournfully; at the same time, as if mechanically raising a hand to feel of
his ears.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STARTLING AWAKENING.</span></h2>

<p>It was about four o&#8217;clock on the following afternoon when the three
canoes containing the boys of the Silver Fox Patrol, accompanied by their two
guides, drew up once more on the lake shore, and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span> preparations for going into camp were
hastily commenced, since night would soon be upon them.</p>

<p>Jim had selected this site for their last camp on this lake. When they left
it, they intended going through the rest of the chain, and then seeking the
railroad, with the idea of starting homeward again.</p>

<p>And Thad wondered whether, in picking out this camp, Jim might not have had
an eye to his own affairs. Perhaps it was not many miles away from the shack of
Cale Martin, the man who had been logger, trapper, guide, and was now about to
turn his superior knowledge concerning foxes into a profitable channel, and
raise them for their valuable furs.</p>

<p>Thad hoped that for the sake of Jim&#8217;s peace of mind he might carry out
his plan before they broke camp here. And secretly he was determined that,
should the guide decide to take a chance at finding Old Cale at home, he would
not be averse to accompanying Jim across country to the place where Little Lina
used to live, before she ran away with Jim.</p>

<p>Despite his positive conviction that he was really on the eve of succeeding
with his fire-making, by the aid of his little bow, and the twirling stick,
Giraffe had failed to accomplish what he expected that morning. Why, he hardly
ate any breakfast, so engrossed had he been in his &#8220;fiddling&#8221; as
Bumpus contemptuously called it, whenever he saw <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span> the tall scout working that clumsy
little bow. But as usual, some little thing went wrong that spoiled the whole
combination; and of course fire did not reward the hard labor Giraffe put
in.</p>

<p>He looked so bitterly disappointed that even Bumpus did not have the heart to
taunt him; though as a rule the fat boy could be depended on to do his share of
such.</p>

<p>But then, it had been arranged that Giraffe and Bumpus were to go out on a
hunt on the following day, all by themselves, and without even a guide along.
Giraffe had boasted so often now, that he felt himself fully competent to look
after himself when adrift in the woods, that Thad thought it might be a good
thing to give him the chance. And there was Bumpus, eager to make use of his new
gun; nothing would please him better than to accompany the tall scout.</p>

<p>Of course neither Thad, nor any one else for that matter, ever suspected that
they would bag any game, unless it might be a few half-tame partridges, that
would sit on a limb, and wait to be knocked over. Indeed, Thad was of the
opinion that in the end the two bold Nimrods might even get lost, and have to be
searched for.</p>

<p>But then, they would unquestionably leave a plain trail that the guides could
pick up without great trouble; and the experience would be worth much to both
Giraffe and Bumpus. They were really <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_153'></a>153</span> getting too &#8220;scrappy&#8221; in their dealings
with each other; and a little spice, such as must accompany losing themselves in
the woods, and being dependent on each other entirely, might draw them together,
Thad thought, and make them appreciate each other more.</p>

<p>As they sat around the blaze that night, after they had partaken of a
generous supper, Thad purposely led the conversation to the subject of fires in
the woods. Allan had told of some experiences he met with some years back, and
of course both guides were able to supplement this with stirring yarns that
thrilled the blood of the young listeners.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I reckon, now, Eli?&#8221; Thad went on, after the guide had
finished what he had to tell; &#8220;that you never saw the pine woods in better
condition for a fire than they are right now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet air a fact,&#8221; replied the other, emphatically. &#8220;Dry as
tinder, an&#8217; ef we doan&#8217;t git sum snow mighty soon, I guess as haow
ther&#8217;ll be thousands o&#8217; acres o&#8217; vallerable land burned over
afore Thanksgivin&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeou must a seen sum lands thet hed be&#8217;n burned, on ther way up on
ther train,&#8221; interjected Jim, breaking his long silence; &#8220;an&#8217;
yeou kin understan&#8217; jest how lonesum they &#8217;pears like, with ther tall
pines astandin&#8217; thar like flagpoles, black, and withaout ary limb; er else
alayin&#8217; in windrows on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_154'></a>154</span> ther ground. Allers makes me feel bad tew see sech
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the game deserts a burned tract, too,&#8221; declared Allan.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure dew,&#8221; Jim went on, with a shake of the head. &#8220;Yew
never seen a more desolate region than sech a burned territory. Everybody moves
aout quick as they can; fact is, most on &#8217;em hes gut ther houses burned,
an&#8217; doan&#8217;t hev ter kerry much away with &#8217;em. I hopes as haow
it&#8217;ll snow er rain right soon, so&#8217;s tew save miles an&#8217; miles
o&#8217; woodland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the fire wardens have their work cut out for them at this season
of the year, you can easily believe,&#8221; observed Allan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder now if we&#8217;ll see a real genuine forest fire while
we&#8217;re up here,&#8221; remarked Giraffe, with considerable interest.
&#8220;My! but she must look great to see them pines aflamin&#8217; up like big
torches. Now, you needn&#8217;t give me that look, Thad, because I haven&#8217;t
forgot my promise, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t acarryin&#8217; a single match along
with me day after day. But if <i>somebody else</i> sets fire to the woods, I
have as good a right to look as the next one, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have, Giraffe,&#8221; replied the scoutmaster, relieved,
because this overpowering passion on the part of the tall boy had given him many
anxious minutes since coming into Maine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of these fires come after the loggers have <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span> done their work,&#8221; Allan
volunteered. &#8220;You see, they leave a tremendous amount of stuff behind; all
the limbs and branches of the trees they have cut down, as they are only after
the main stem; so when this gets nice and dry, after a year or so, and a fire
starts, with a brisk wind to whip it, what follows is more than I can describe.
I saw one such fire, and we only escaped with our lives by the quick wit of a
logger along with the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do, Allan?&#8221; asked Bumpus, eagerly. &#8220;You know,
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out with Giraffe to-morrow, and if we did meet up with a
forest on fire, I couldn&#8217;t run like he can, with his long legs; so
I&#8217;d like to know another way to give the old fire the go-by. Please
explain how you cheated it. Why, Allan, it might save my life too, for all you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to hear that you&#8217;re interested, Bumpus,&#8221; answered the
other readily. &#8220;And I think every one of you ought to know about it. When
you&#8217;re out hunting, try and keep the location of any stream you happen to
pass, in your mind. Then in case of being beset by fire, make your way there,
and get in, up to your neck. You&#8217;re going to be safe there, every time. If
it gets hot, duck under, and cool off. I&#8217;ll sure never forget the time I
had; but then I hope none of you will ever have to hunt for a stream, or that
you&#8217;ll even see a forest fire when up here, no matter how much Giraffe
wants to look on one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>Giraffe had
dropped out of the circle, and apparently some idea had just flashed into his
mind connected with his pursuit of that slippery contract, whereby he expected
sooner or later to make fire come, after the fashion of the far away islanders
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>No one paid much attention, for they were heartily sick of seeing him sawing
away with his little bow, wasting so much time, most of them thought; though
Thad for his part was secretly pleased to see that the tall scout stuck at his
apparently hopeless job; with a persistence that must win out in the end.</p>

<p>Thad had been explaining just what the new system of standing sentry was to
be. Each of the scouts would have his turn, even Bumpus being called on, though
his partner was to be old Eli. There being eight of them, their fixed posts
would not run much over an hour and a half each; and it was to be expected that
the boys might receive more or less benefit from having to assume some of the
responsibility of the camp&#8217;s security.</p>

<p>Bumpus had been yawning for some time; and presently, taking advantage of a
lull in the conversation the fat boy clumsily gained his feet, and made a lunge
for the nearest tent, in which he was supposed to sleep.</p>

<p>No one was really surprised to see Bumpus trip, and go floundering to the
earth, for he frequently <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_157'></a>157</span> got his legs twisted, and did that; but when there
was a shout of consternation, and the tall form of Giraffe bounded erect they
realized that Bumpus had actually fallen over his chum, not noticing him,
because his eyes were so heavy with sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Giraffe, excuse me, please!&#8221; he remarked, as he rolled over,
and sat up. &#8220;I give you my word I didn&#8217;t know you were there. I was
rubbing my eyes, because they felt so hot and tired, lookin&#8217; into the fire
so long. Hope I didn&#8217;t hurt you any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt me,&#8221; grumbled Giraffe; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care for
that so much, even if you&#8217;d broken a rib or two in my side; but to think
that you&#8217;d upset me just when I was agoin&#8217; to make it burst out into
a nice little flame! Why, she was smokin&#8217; to beat the band when you
knocked it all into a cocked hat by bustin&#8217; my bow; an&#8217; now
I&#8217;ll have to sit up another hour makin&#8217; a new one. It&#8217;s always
the way. I&#8217;m havin&#8217; the toughest luck ever was, about that business;
but I can hang on, like a bulldog to the seat of your trousers when you&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; over the fence. I&#8217;m game, all right. I&#8217;m agoin&#8217;
to get that, if it takes a leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his bow, he found, could be easily repaired, as it was only the cord that
had been broken. And half an hour later everybody in camp was sound asleep,
saving Thad and Allan, who had taken the first watch, so as to sit there, and
talk in whispers; for the patrol leader wanted to tell his chum all <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span> about Jim&#8217;s case,
because he felt so great an admiration for the short guide.</p>

<p>When their turn had expired, according to the little nickel watch Thad
carried, they woke up Eli, who, with Bumpus was to take the next spell; in turn
they were expected to arouse Step Hen and Davy Jones, to be followed by Jim and
Giraffe; and this would finish the night, as daylight must arrive while the last
named were on duty.</p>

<p>Thad was a good sleeper, although as a rule the slightest thing of an unusual
nature aroused him. He believed that the camp would be well watched, and when he
lay down did not allow himself to get to thinking of anything to the contrary,
for fear that if his brain once got to working, he might lie awake for a long
time.</p>

<p>He had a dim recollection of the two boys who occupied the tent with him,
Step Hen and Davy, creeping out, when Eli summoned them. Then came an uncertain
length of time, which Thad could never measure; for he was sound asleep when it
seemed to him some one was shouting something in his dreams. He sat up, and
bumped his head on some object that had fallen out of place; but he was now
fully awake, and felt a thrill when he heard real shouts outside, in the voices
of Step Hen and Davy Jones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, everybody get busy here! The whole <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span> camp&#8217;s on fire, and the wind
driving it into the woods like hot-cakes! Hurry up! Hurry up,
everybody!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>FIGHTING THE FLAMES.</span></h2>

<p>Out of the tent crawled Thad, utterly regardless of the fact that he was not
altogether warmly clad for a cold night. And what met his eyes when he reached
the open was enough to excite him still further.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing pretty stiffly, and the fire had already jumped into the
brush surrounding the camp. If given its head for even a short time it seemed
bound to get started in the dead pine needles; and once it spread there, all the
desperate efforts of a dozen fire-fighters would be wasted.</p>

<p>Several figures could be seen, bounding here and there, and slashing at the
red flames with anything they could get hold of that would answer to bring about
a halt in their spread.</p>

<p>Of course these must be the late guardians of the sleeping camp, who were now
shouting so strenuously, and begging the rest of the campers to come to their
aid&#8211;Step Hen and Davy Jones; besides, there were the guides, hard at work,
having been aroused with the first cries; for they still persisted <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> in sleeping under a rude
shelter they had made out of branches and weeds.</p>

<p>Thad rushed into the fray, and began to do his very utmost to keep the
dreaded fire in check. He saw that the others were also crawling forth, Bumpus,
Giraffe and Allan, all occupants of the first tent. And realizing the importance
of concerted action, they lost not a second in getting busy.</p>

<p>Bumpus, in particular, was a sight to behold, and had he been less busy Thad
felt that he must have doubled up with laughter to see him. He persisted in
donning a most stunning red-checked suit of pajamas; for being so stout he did
not suffer from the cold as much as some of the others. And as his simple heart
was wrapped up in the business that just then engaged his full attention, Bumpus
was prancing around, looking more like a clown from the circus than anything
Thad could think of. But all the same the fat boy fought, tooth and nail, at the
spreading fire. He had on his shoes, as had the others, so that he could jump on
the creeping flames when all else failed; and using an extra piece of canvas
that sometimes had done duty as a tent floor, Bumpus sailed into the fray like a
hurricane.</p>

<p>Indeed, they were all as busy as beavers for a short time. Every scout seemed
to feel that it would be a lasting disgrace on the name of the Silver Fox Patrol
if that fire got away into the woods. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_161'></a>161</span> They had assumed the responsibilities of assistant
fire wardens; and it would be a sorry joke indeed if, instead of putting out a
conflagration they themselves were the cause of one that swept the whole
adjacent territory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it thunder!&#8221; shouted Giraffe, as he threshed wildly at
every head of fire he could see near his boundary of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him again, boys!&#8221; shrilled Bumpus, as he continued to do his
great act of working with both hands and feet at the same time, all serving to
quench the threatening flames.</p>

<p>But Step Hen and Davy were strangely silent, though they worked as hard as
any one. They knew that they were to blame for all the trouble; for they had
slept on their post, and with this sad result.</p>

<p>Finally success came to the hard working scouts, and their allies, the two
guides. The fire was completely routed, bag and baggage, before it managed to
get a good foothold in the dry woods. And perspiring as though it were the good
old summer time, the boys hastened to get more clothes on them, for fear of
catching cold.</p>

<p>The fire was resurrected, and they sat down to have a powwow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you needn&#8217;t all look at us that way,&#8221; grunted Step
Hen. &#8220;We&#8217;re guilty, all right. Knock us all you want to, because I
just guess now <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> we
deserve it. But we never meant to go to sleep there by the fire, did we,
Davy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say not,&#8221; replied the other culprit, looking
quite dejected. &#8220;We kept atellin&#8217; each other that we mustn&#8217;t
sleep right along; and then to think that after all we did drop off, and both
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First thing I remember,&#8221; said Step Hen, as if resolved, after
pleading guilty, to open up, and throw himself on the mercy of the court;
&#8220;I heard a queer crackling noise, and openin&#8217; my eyes, my stars! the
whole world seemed like it was afire. I gave Davy a punch in the side, and then
jumped for it. We thought at first we could get her under control; then I saw it
was no go, for the old fire kept extendin&#8217; all the while. So I started to
wake you all, and Davy, he joined in. After that Eli and Jim joined us, and then
the rest of you came. And believe me, fellers, Davy and me&#8217;ll never forget
it. You did handsome by us, and we&#8217;ve been saved from disgrace that would
have sent us into an early grave, hey, Davy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; grunted the other, who was licking several burns he
had received on his bare hands during the fierce little engagement just ended,
though he made no complaint, seeming to think he had gotten off pretty easily,
considering the serious offense of which he had been guilty, that of sleeping on
his post, and which might have cost him his life in war times, had he been a
soldier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>Thad noticed
this fact, and quietly getting out some salve he carried for just such occasions
forced Davy to let him attend to his hurts, though the other insisted that they
&#8220;did not amount to much, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you think it started?&#8221; Giraffe asked, and in so doing he
really voiced the thoughts of everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I reckon that&#8217;s an easy one to answer,&#8221; replied Step
Hen, promptly. &#8220;Anybody c&#8217;n see at just a single look that the wind must
have picked up a live coal from the fire, and carried it into a bunch of stuff
to leeward. After that it was fanned, till it spread wider and wider. That was
going on while Davy and me snoozed away like a pair of sillies. No use talking,
boys, I&#8217;m ashamed of myself; and let me tell you, it&#8217;ll be a long
time before I ever go to sleep on duty again&#8211;not if I have to keep jabbing
a pin into my leg every minute or so, to make me jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that explanation go, Thad?&#8221; asked Bumpus, still breathing
hard after his recent violent exertions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it looks that way, for the fire was actually to leeward of the
camp when I first saw it,&#8221; answered the patrol leader; but there must have
been something in his manner rather than his speech that caught the attention of
Giraffe.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you ain&#8217;t <i>quite</i> satisfied, are you, Thad?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span> he remarked,
pointedly. &#8220;You just keep athinkin&#8217; that perhaps it
<i>wasn&#8217;t</i> an accident after all? Am I right, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! what does that kind of talk stand for?&#8221; burst out Bumpus.
&#8220;Are you hinting that it was all a part of a dark scheme to burn us out of
camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till Eli and Jim come back,&#8221; Thad went on.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve noticed that they&#8217;re not with us right now. Fact is,
they took the lantern, and went off about the time we were finishing our
dressing. But before they went, Jim gave me to understand what they had some
reason to suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The work of big Cale Martin and his crowd? Is that what you&#8217;re
aiming to tell us, Thad?&#8221; demanded Giraffe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; was all Thad said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my, I thought you meant the game poachers!&#8221; exclaimed
Bumpus, who had made a half movement in the direction of his gun, standing
conveniently near.</p>

<p>The two guides joined the circle around the fire. Eli held his hands out to
the blaze, as though they felt cold in that nipping night air. Jim simply caught
the inquiring eye of the scoutmaster, and immediately nodded his head in the
affirmative. And Thad knew from that they had surely made some sort of important
discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Jim?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_165'></a>165</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been around here; we found ther
tracks lots o&#8217; places,&#8221; came the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Cale and Si and Ed?&#8221; asked the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;On&#8217;y Si and Ed,&#8221; answered Jim. &#8220;Cale he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t thar
&#8217;tall. We&#8217;d sized up his big tracks ef he&#8217;d be&#8217;n. They was two men
in thet canoe larst night, ye seen; wall them must a be&#8217;n ther lot as fired the
brush. I guess as haow Cale, he muster gone back tew his shack by
naow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what on earth could they expect to get by burning us out?&#8221;
demanded Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fust place they never oxpected tew burn ther camp,&#8221; observed
Jim; &#8220;ef they hed, doan&#8217;t yew believe they&#8217;d agone tew
windward tew start thet blaze? Wall, they hed a game wuth tew o&#8217; thet up
ther sleeve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what it was, Jim,&#8221; urged Thad, though he himself had
already jumped to a conclusion in the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess as haow they thort we&#8217;d hev tew make off a long distance
away frum the camp tew fight the fire; an&#8217; then they&#8217;d hev plenty
o&#8217; time tew clean her aout; but yeou see, we didn&#8217;t get fur away
&#8217;tall, so they hed all ther work fur nawthin&#8217;. But them tracks was as
plain as anything, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t they, Eli?&#8221; Jim went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;They be,&#8221; was the conclusive testimony of the older guide; and
every one of the scouts understood <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_166'></a>166</span> that Eli had set the seal of his approval on all
that Jim had said.</p>

<p>It was certainly very unpleasant to realize that they were objects of desire
on the part of even a pair of unscrupulous scamps, granting that big Cale Martin
had retired from the combination. The boys seemed to get more indignant the
longer they discussed the situation.</p>

<p>There was Bumpus, usually so mild and peaceful, fairly palpitating with a
desire to draw a bead upon those two unprincipled rascals.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t stand for much nonsense from outsiders, do we
fellers?&#8221; he appealed to the other five. &#8220;Once before on this trip
some bad men thought to get fresh with the Silver Fox Patrol. You all know what
happened to Charley Barnes, the leader of that bunch of yeggs that broke into
the bank. Didn&#8217;t we make the capture though, and astonish Sheriff Green?
And ain&#8217;t we going to get ever so much money for recovering the stolen
stuff? Well, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen to those husky chaps if
they get too gay with us. They&#8217;d better go slow. If they can read,
they&#8217;ll see we&#8217;re marked &#8216;dangerous, handle with
care!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Giraffe, &#8220;we&#8217;ll just have to get busy,
and hand these sillies over to the head game warden. They&#8217;re trying to
interfere with our having the time of our lives up here in Maine; and we
don&#8217;t stand for anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>None of them
felt like getting back to their blankets in a hurry, after all that scare; so
they just sat there around the fire, some of them with the blankets thrown over
their shoulders, and compared notes all along the line; for what the guides had
just told concerning the scheme of the unprincipled poachers filled the scouts
with both indignation and anger.</p>

<p>And more than one of them resolved that when his time came to watch, he would
make sure to keep a loaded gun close to his hand, to be used to give the
prowlers the fright of their lives.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHEN EVEN A COMPASS FAILED THEM.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What would you do, Bumpus,&#8221; said Step Hen, after a while,
&#8220;if you couldn&#8217;t find a creek to wade in, with the fire all around
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, d&#8217;ye know, I was just athinkin&#8217; about that same
thing,&#8221; replied the fat scout, who had thrown a blanket around him, and
not bothered dressing; and as he sat there on a log he looked somewhat like a
lazy Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you came to some conclusion,&#8221; observed Giraffe;
&#8220;because, if we happen to run across a conflagration to-morrow, when
we&#8217;re out hunting, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_168'></a>168</span> it&#8217;ll be some comfort to me to know, when
I&#8217;m spinning along, that you&#8217;re snug and safe behind, and not being
devoured by the flames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the only thing I could think of,&#8221; Bumpus went on, soberly;
&#8220;seeing that a feller can&#8217;t sprout wings right away when he needs
the same; nor hatch up an aeroplane to carry him out of the danger
zone&#8211;the only thing for me to do would be to hunt around for a
woodchuck&#8217;s hole, and push in, feet first.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh at that remark, which seemed to surprise Bumpus, for he
looked with elevated eyebrows at each of the others in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to think I&#8217;m joking,&#8221; he remarked, as if offended
by the levity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Giraffe, &#8220;in the first place you&#8217;d
possibly find a heap of trouble discovering a woodchuck&#8217;s hole in these
Maine woods, especially when you were in a big hurry; and then again, fancy the
kind of woodchuck that had a hole of a size to accommodate <i>you</i>, Bumpus
Hawtree!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat boy sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I get all along the line,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no place in all this world for a feller that&#8217;s
nearly as round as he is tall. I tell you I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to find
<i>some</i> way of getting rid of all this superabundance of flesh, if I have to
walk it off by taking tremendous tramps. Some people tell me it c&#8217;n be done by
going hungry a week or two at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_169'></a>169</span> a time; but what&#8217;s the use of living if you
can&#8217;t eat, that&#8217;s what? So I&#8217;m in a peck of trouble.
Won&#8217;t somebody tell me what to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, with such an open invitation, they hastened to accomodate him; and
if poor Bumpus tried even a part of the numerous joking plans offered for his
consideration, he would soon have no need for either food or energy, since they
would, as he declared, be &#8220;putting his wooden overcoat on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, however, the boys began to slip back once more into the tents, all
but Giraffe, who was to finish the night with Jim; although there was hardly
another hour now before daylight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just suits me, boys!&#8221; declared the tall scout, as he prepared to
sit out his turn as sentry; &#8220;you see, I can be thinking over that knotty
problem I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to figure out before we leave this part of
the country. And I&#8217;ve an idea that I&#8217;m getting mighty warm on that
proposition now. Would sure had it dead to rights, only for clumsy Bumpus
tumbling over me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no one paid much attention to what Giraffe was saying; they had by now
grown so accustomed to hearing him always promising great things by
&#8220;to-morrow&#8221; that it &#8220;went in one ear, and came out of the
other,&#8221; Davy Jones said.</p>

<p>When the morning came, the camp became a scene of activity. While some of the
party were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span> busily
engaged cooking a good breakfast&#8211;and it needed a lot to satisfy the
healthy appetites of six growing boys, not to mention two husky
guides,&#8211;others were examining the tracks that had been found after the
fire.</p>

<p>And it was the universal opinion that two prowlers had indeed started the
fire with the idea that the inmates of the camp, rushing out to fight its
spread, might get so far away that it would leave the way open for the thieves
to make a sweep of any valuables left unguarded in that exciting hour.</p>

<p>Bumpus and Giraffe were making all their preparations looking to their
&#8220;sallying forth,&#8221; as the latter termed it, &#8220;like Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza of old, determined to do wonderful things.&#8221; Thad saw that
they felt as if they knew it all; and he realized that in such a case advice was
not desired, so he said nothing about what they ought to take. If they forgot
anything, they must do without, and next time think again.</p>

<p>Presently the two waved their hands merrily to their chums, and started
forth. Bumpus looked like a well-laden, led animal as he trotted along at the
heels of the tall scout, who was to do the piloting of the expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep supper for us if we&#8217;re late,&#8221; airily
called back Bumpus. &#8220;We may get further away than we can manage in one
day, and have to camp <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_171'></a>171</span> alone, like Thad and Step Hen did. And if some of
them old wolves pay us a visit, they&#8217;ll wish they hadn&#8217;t. Giraffe is
toting his old heavy weight rifle; and here I am with my new double-barreled
gun, and fifty shells. Ketch me gettin&#8217; caught like Step Hen did, with a
few charges for my trusty weapon. Good-bye, fellers! See you later!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, and good luck!&#8221; called out Davy Jones, waving his cap
three times to represent his idea as to the right kind of a send-off.</p>

<p>The hunters got along very well for several miles, though Giraffe was forever
forging protests from Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye take me for, Giraffe?&#8221; he would exclaim, as he
caught up with the waiting leader, and wiped the perspiration from his brow,
despite the fact that the day was pretty cold. &#8220;You know I ain&#8217;t
built on the same lines as you; and in a case of this kind, the one that c&#8217;n go
faster just has to accommodate himself to the pace of the slow one. You&#8217;re
the hare, and I&#8217;m like the poor old tortoise; but please remember that the
turtle came in winner after all in the race. Not always to the swift, you know,
does the race go. I may beat you out in the long run, with the endurance test.
If I&#8217;ve got anything at all, it&#8217;s grit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you will,&#8221; sneered Giraffe; but after the third stop he did
moderate his speed considerably; perhaps he was beginning to get a little tired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span> himself, and did
not feel unwilling to draw in a peg or two.</p>

<p>At noon they ate a cold lunch, for they had come upon certain tracks that
told Giraffe there had been an animal of some kind there&#8211;he wished he knew
how to tell what species it belonged to, and just how long ago the tracks had
been made.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mark me, Bumpus,&#8221; he said impressively, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to learn all those kind of things right away, as soon as I can take my
mind off this pesky fire puzzle. I c&#8217;n see how handy it is to be able to read
signs when you&#8217;re off huntin&#8217;. Why, when we start to follerin&#8217;
these here tracks, after we&#8217;ve eaten our grub, how on earth do we know
whether they were made a week ago; or if some cow broke loose from a backwoods
home up here, and wandered this way. A nice pair of chumps we&#8217;d be,
wouldn&#8217;t we, if we went and shot up a pet cow, and had to pay damages? I
reckon the boys&#8217;d never got over the joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I was thinking myself, Giraffe,&#8221; agreed
the other, as he sat down beside the tall scout on a fallen tree, and took out
the lunch from his haversack, for he had carried it all morning, and Giraffe had
let him, too; &#8220;if we&#8217;re going in for this scouting business, we
ought to swallow the whole business. Now, as for learning things connected with
the woods, where could you find any fellers better qualified to put us straight
than we&#8217;ve <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
got in Thad and Allan? What one don&#8217;t know, the other sure does. I&#8217;m
bound to learn the game. Owning this dandy gun has given me a new idea. I used
to say &#8216;oh! what&#8217;s the use of bothering, when you&#8217;ve got somebody
else to do your thinking for you?&#8217; But now I begin to see that you
can&#8217;t always depend on others. Right here is a case in point.&#8221;</p>

<p>As their minds ran about in the same channel the two boys managed to get
along splendidly. Their little differences of the past were, for the time being
at least, quite forgotten; and they seemed drawn toward each other as two
comrades should be.</p>

<p>But both began to complain because thus far neither of them had had occasion
to make use of their gun. If this was a game country, why was it two such
industrious hunters did not get a crack at something, whether a deer, a moose,
or even a fox&#8211;anything would have been welcome as a change from the
monotony.</p>

<p>Perhaps Giraffe would have been surprised if told that he and the puffing
Bumpus made quite too much noise to prevent any wary and timid deer from staying
within a quarter of a mile of them. And also that often they were doing their
hunting &#8220;down the wind,&#8221; so that their scent at such times was
carried to the nostrils of the suspicious game long before the hunters came in
sight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>Finally they
came across some partridges, and Bumpus managed to bag a couple with two shots
from his new gun. He was greatly elated by the success attending his efforts,
even though Giraffe did mention something about the birds insisting on remaining
on the branch of that tree so long that they must either have been frozen there,
or else wanted to commit suicide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they came to the right place, then,&#8221; said Bumpus,
sturdily, as he crammed new shells in his gun; &#8220;I&#8217;m the feller to
help every partridge and deer pass over the divide, that feels like going. Bring
on your game; now we&#8217;re going some!&#8221;</p>

<p>But as the afternoon began to wane they had a shot at nothing else, though
once Giraffe became excited, and declared he had caught a glimpse of a deer
making off in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ain&#8217;t it a shame,&#8221; he went on to say, &#8220;how that
deer just knew we were coming? Seems like somebody went ahead with a trumpet,
and announced that two hunters were on the trail. After that they all hike out.
But seems to me it&#8217;s getting some cold right now, Bumpus. My fingers begin
to tingle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Told you to wear the old mitts Step Hen offered you, but you sneered
at the idea. I&#8217;m feeling pretty cold myself, considerin&#8217; that
I&#8217;m on the move all the time. Say, where are we anyhow, and how far from
the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>Giraffe looked
blankly at Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the compass, and we c&#8217;n see which way is north, all
right. Then east is off that way on the right, south around yonder, and west
here. But where in the dickens is that camp, south, north or east? Honest,
Bumpus, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more do I, Giraffe,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;And d&#8217;ye
know, this makes me think of that Injun that got lost, and was found, half
starved, by some white men; but he was too proud to admit his little
shortcoming; so when they asked him if he hadn&#8217;t kinder managed to get
twisted in his bearings, he slaps his breast with his hand, take a pose like
this, and says he: &#8216;Injun not lost; wigwam lost; Injun <i>here</i>!&#8217; And
we&#8217;re like that Injun, Giraffe; oh! no, we&#8217;re not lost one little
bit, because we know we&#8217;re here. But I just can&#8217;t amble on any
longer. Suppose we stop and camp. These partridges will taste prime. Yum! yum,
can&#8217;t get at &#8217;em too soon to please me. Get busy, and light a fire,
Giraffe; that&#8217;s your part of the contract always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure will, if you give me a few matches, Bumpus,&#8221; replied the
other, wearily dropping his heavy rifle, that began to feel like a ton of
lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matches! Why, you&#8217;re the fire-maker; and I thought you&#8217;d
take care of that part of the business!&#8221; exclaimed Bumpus, looking a
little alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what a silly you can be, Bumpus; don&#8217;t you know I promised
Thad never to carry a single <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_176'></a>176</span> match around with me? And now, look what a fix
we&#8217;re in, lost in the Maine woods, with night coming on, and gettin&#8217;
colder every minute; and not a single match to start a fire with. I see our
finish all right. When they find us some days from now, we&#8217;ll be just
frozen stiff, that&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two tenderfeet looked at each other, but there was no smile on either
face now; for affairs had assumed too serious a phase to admit of merriment.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br /><span class='h2fs'>GIRAFFE TRIES FOR THE FOURTEENTH TIME.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Whatever can we do, Giraffe?&#8221; asked Bumpus, presently, after he
had sighed several times, in a most forlorn way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; remarked the other, making out to be little concerned about
the matter, although his manner did not deceive the fat boy in the least, for he
knew Giraffe was worried greatly; &#8220;there are lots of things we can do, all
right; but you see the trouble is, Bumpus, they ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to help
out much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a tough hole, all right,&#8221; grunted the other,
disconsolately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about Thad and Step Hen camping out;&#8221; Giraffe went on to
say, &#8220;why their troubles couldn&#8217;t <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_177'></a>177</span> be mentioned in the same breath with ours, and you
know it. They had aplenty of matches along, and could get all the blaze they
wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And say, think of having the best part of a fine young buck to
cook!&#8221; burst out Bumpus, with another groan. &#8220;As for us, we&#8217;ve
got the game all right; but however can we get down to eating partridges that
ain&#8217;t ever even been near a fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit talkin&#8217; of eating, Bumpus; you fairly set me wild,&#8221;
declared the tall boy, rubbing his empty stomach, as though its calls were
growing more insistent with a knowledge that they must pass unheeded now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must be hungry?&#8221; suggested Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry ain&#8217;t no name for it,&#8221; Giraffe replied.
&#8220;That&#8217;s always the way, I&#8217;ve been told. When there ain&#8217;t
no water, a feller feels as if his tongue was stickin&#8217; to the roof of his
mouth. And Bumpus, bein&#8217; hungry ain&#8217;t the very worst of it,
either!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat boy sat up, and looked at his companion in misery as though
startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you mean, Giraffe, by slingin&#8217; that scare into me;
I&#8217;d like to know what&#8217;s worse than starvin&#8217; to death in a
single night?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! shucks! don&#8217;t you worry about that,&#8221; the other went
on, with a sneer. &#8220;Not so much chance of our comin&#8217; to such an end
in so short a time. But there is real danger around us, Bumpus.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>&#8220;Say, do
you mean about them wolves?&#8221; exclaimed Bumpus, with a tremble in his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I do mean,&#8221; came the reply &#8220;When
they tackled our comrades, why they were bold as anything, even if the boys did
have a fire burning all the time. Think of how we&#8217;re up against it,
without a single match to start a blaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s only one thing for us to do, Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me what that is?&#8221; demanded the tall scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climb a tree,&#8221; replied Bumpus, promptly.</p>

<p>Giraffe made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we could do that, as a last resort, Bumpus; but the chances
are, if we did, we&#8217;d freeze before morning!&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard old hunters say that of all the agony they ever endured,
being kept in a tree all night was the worst. Feel in your pockets again,
Bumpus; try everywhere, and see if you can only scare up <i>one</i> single
match. If you did, we&#8217;d be mighty careful not to waste it, I tell you.
This is a case of &#8216;my kingdom for a match!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>So the fat scout commenced a systematic search, Every single pocket did he
feel in with trembling fingers, while his comrade watched his face anxiously,
knowing that it was likely to indicate the success or failure of the search.</p>

<p>When he saw a sudden grin come upon that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_179'></a>179</span> broad countenance Giraffe felt like bursting out
into a yell of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got one, haven&#8217;t you Bumpus?&#8221; he exclaimed, eagerly.
&#8220;That was a bully good idea of mine after all, you see, having you look
again. Say, won&#8217;t we be careful of that one precious match, though? And
won&#8217;t we have the fine dry stuff all ready to kindle, as soon as I strike
it. You must let me handle things, Bumpus, because, you know, I&#8217;m more
used to&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter with you? Don&#8217;t tell me it
<i>ain&#8217;t</i> a match after all? Oh! thunder!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus had slowly drawn his hand out of his pocket, and held some object up
between his forefinger and his thumb. It was about the length of a match, but
had a sharpened point, instead of a blunt head.</p>

<p>&#8220;A&#8211;a miserable toothpick that I just dropped into my pocket when
we ate that dinner at the restaurant!&#8221; groaned the wretched Bumpus,
staring first at the offending object, and then turning a piteous face toward
his comrade.</p>

<p>Giraffe managed to rise to the occasion. Perhaps he remembered that Thad had
really committed the other into his charge; and that it was to him the
scoutmaster would look to give a good account of the expedition. And then again,
Bumpus was so shocked by the series of calamities which had befallen them that
he looked almost ready to collapse.</p>

<p>So Giraffe drew himself up, and assumed a confidence that he was far from
feeling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take on so, Bumpus,&#8221; he
went on to say, almost cheerily. &#8220;It may not be so very bad, after all.
Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s forget that we&#8217;re scouts; and must keep a stiff
upper lip whenever things turn out wrong. We&#8217;ll just do the best we can;
and I reckon it&#8217;ll all come out right in the end. It nearly always does,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>At least his words and manner had some effect on the almost exhausted fat
boy, who brightened up more or less.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s nice of you talking that way, Giraffe,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re the right kind of a chum to have in time of trouble.
But say, ain&#8217;t it gettin&#8217; cold though? Is that why you&#8217;re
slapping your arms around so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it, and see how quick you feel warmer, Bumpus,&#8221; replied the
other, with the patronizing air of one who is superior in knowledge, and willing
to impart all he knows; &#8220;you see, the violent action starts the heart to
beating nearly twice as fast as it does ordinarily; and that pumps the blood
harder, so it gets to the very end of your extremities. That&#8217;s what Thad
says, anyhow; and it sure enough works.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, for a minute or two both lads kept up a strenuous exercise, though it was
too much for poor Bumpus, who presently stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel better, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded Giraffe imperiously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>&#8220;A whole
lot; but doin&#8217; that has one bad point, I find,&#8221; said Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;As how?&#8221; asked his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it keeps on making you all the hungrier; exercise always has that
effect on me. Why, Giraffe, I feel like I could eat a whole ham right
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you to let up on that style of talk; you&#8217;re
just making me groan inside every time you speak of eatin&#8217;. We ought to be
tryin&#8217; our level best to better our condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know anything that would help us, Giraffe; so
it&#8217;s up to you to get us out of this ugly hole. Perhaps we might use a
shell from my gun, and by taking out most of the powder, snap it off, and start
a fire going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strange to say, Giraffe did not seem to take to the idea, simple though it
was; and later on commended by Thad and Allan, when they heard about the
trouble. The fact was, Giraffe had suddenly remembered something.</p>

<p>&#8220;You leave it to me, and see if I don&#8217;t pull out a trick worth
while,&#8221; he remarked mysteriously; and Bumpus saw him turn aside to get
down on his knees.</p>

<p>For some time the fat boy sat there, apparently lost in bitter reflections.
Now and then he would give a start, and look around him hastily, after which he
would heave a great sigh, or else groan <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_182'></a>182</span> dismally. From this it might be assumed that Bumpus
was allowing himself to dwell upon many a glorious supper he had devoured in the
company of his Boy Scout chums; and just then he was enjoying things the best he
knew how, he would remember the desolation that confronted himself and
Giraffe.</p>

<p>Then he would pick up one of the two partridges that had fallen to his new
Marlin ten bore, look critically at it, feel the meat on the plump breast; and
then shake his head, as though the idea of having to turn cannibal, and devour
the game raw did not appeal at all to him.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when he aroused himself from this abstraction he became
conscious of a strange humming sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; there, Giraffe?&#8221; he demanded, as the noise
certainly proceeded from the spot where his chum was down on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you see,&#8221; replied the other, slowly, &#8220;I fetched my
little bow and fire-makin&#8217; outfit along with me, thinkin&#8217; I might
have a chance to try a scheme I got in my head. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; right
into it now, because I want to start business before it&#8217;s real plumb
dark!&#8221;</p>

<p>But far from reassuring the dejected Bumpus, these words only made him grunt.
Had he not watched Giraffe working away for dear life with that miserable little
outfit a dozen times, and always <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_183'></a>183</span> with the same result&#8211;getting perilously near
success, but always missing it by a hair&#8217;s breadth?</p>

<p>What chance did they have of securing the much desired fire, if all depended
on Giraffe succeeding in inducing that twirling stick to generate enough heat to
throw off a spark that would catch in the dry tinder? None at all. It was only a
hollow mockery. Some smart scouts might be able to do the little trick; but up
to now it had baffled the skill of Giraffe. Why, even Thad had lost pretty much
all hope of his ever succeeding, Bumpus suspected; and believed that the only
good thing about the tall scout&#8217;s labors was his persistence.</p>

<p>So, shaking his head again dolefully, Bumpus allowed himself to once more
figure out a bill of fare that he would like to commence on, if he only had the
good fortune to sit down at a table in a first-class restaurant. It seemed to
give him untold satisfaction just to imagine the heaping platters that were
being brought before him in rapid succession. Why, in his vivid imagination he
could almost get the delicious odors of the various dishes that had long been
favorites with him; particularly the liver and bacon and fried onions. Oh! how
tantalizing to suddenly arouse himself with a start, to look around at the
rapidly darkening scene of those lonely pine woods, and hear, instead of the
waiter&#8217;s cheery voice, only that continual grinding sound, as the boy with
the never-give-up nature kept sawing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_184'></a>184</span> away with his miserable little bow; and the poor
stick kept whirling back and forwards with a violent motion, in the socket that
held one end.</p>

<p>In the estimation of Bumpus, that was coming down from the sublime to the
ridiculous. He had little confidence in all this labor of Giraffe; though
goodness knows, that if ever success would prove a boon to a couple of stranded
hunters caught in the darkness of a wintry night, with not a match in their
possession, it was then.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LONG VIGIL OF A SCOUT.</span></h2>

<p>It really looked to Bumpus as though sooner or later they must come to
climbing a tree, no matter how cold they found it on such a perch. And as it
would presently be dark, since night was rapidly coming on, he wondered whether
he would not be showing good judgment in selecting the proper kind of a tree,
while there was enough light to see by.</p>

<p>But before he started to look around him, he thought it worth while to
ascertain how his companion was doing; although to tell the truth Bumpus did not
have the slightest hope of any good news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you gettin&#8217; anywhere yet, Giraffe?&#8221; he asked,
as he rose clumsily, and wearily to his feet; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_185'></a>185</span> for his short legs felt very stiff after resting so
long.</p>

<p>The other gave a grunt as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! don&#8217;t bother me with such silly questions, Bumpus. You make
me think of that story of Blue Beard, where the old feller&#8217;s a
waitin&#8217; for his last wife to come down, and get her head taken off; and
she keeps callin&#8217; to her sister, who&#8217;s in the lookout tower: &#8216;Sister
Ann, Sister Ann, don&#8217;t you see anything comin&#8217;?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to know before I&#8211;&#8221; began Bumpus, when the other
interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> know all right, if I get it. But you keep away from
me, Bumpus. Once before, you fell all over me, just when I was on the point of
grabbing a spark. If you know what&#8217;s good for you, keep clear of me now.
I&#8217;m desperately in earnest, I tell you. So be warned, Bumpus!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat scout realized that if he knew what was good for him he had better
give Giraffe a wide berth while he was strumming away with his &#8220;old
fiddle,&#8221; as some of the boys sneeringly described the fire outfit that
continually refused to &#8220;fire&#8221; even a little bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to look for a good tree,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, go, and climb up in it, good and hard,&#8221; Giraffe
answered pettishly; &#8220;but unless you want to get lost, don&#8217;t you dare
go out of sight of this place. Call if you lose sight of me, Bumpus, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span> d&#8217;ye hear? I
don&#8217;t want Thad to say I didn&#8217;t keep an eye on you; but this is a
business that must be attended to.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the while he was sawing away as if his very life depended upon bringing
the ordeal to a successful termination; and possibly Giraffe thought it did.</p>

<p>So Bumpus began to look around him.</p>

<p>He realized that the tall pines were rather out of the question so far as
affording them a chance to climb up; and that he must find some tree of a
different type, with low branches.</p>

<p>It was not hard to find such a retreat in the shape of a thick hemlock, with
its glossy green foliage that had such a delightful scent. Bumpus knew it well,
because on numerous occasions the scouts had plucked masses of similar
&#8220;browse,&#8221; to make the ground feel easier where they slept.</p>

<p>If they had to climb a tree as a last resort, this hemlock would offer all
the advantages they wished. Why, Bumpus could even remember how Eli had told of
an adventure that had befallen him along somewhat similar lines; and how in
order not to fall from his perch in the crotch of a tree, he tied himself there
by means of some stout cord he happened to have along.</p>

<p>Bumpus felt all through his pockets again, and was grievously disappointed
not to discover a hank of fishing cord.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;Seems
like I&#8217;m just out of everything that a feller&#8217;s apt to want when he
gets in a bad pickle like this,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Ketch me bein&#8217;
in such a hole again. Why, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make it the point of my life
to always carry a plenty of matches along; and a line that would be strong
enough to hold a feller, if I had to use it. How would Jim fished up his gun,
and shot them wolves, like he told us, if so be he didn&#8217;t tear his shirt
into strips, an&#8217; made a rope, with a loop at the end, to slip over the end
of his rifle lyin&#8217; on the ground. Next time I get the chance I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to fix a nice clothes line, and wrap it around me every time I go
out in the woods. Never know how handy such things might come in. Wonder how
Giraffe&#8217;s gettin&#8217; along with his sawin&#8217;? But I don&#8217;t
dare say another word, or he&#8217;ll be so mad he might break his silly old bow
on my back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked toward the spot where he could see the dim figure of the
industrious fire worshipper bending low over at his labor.</p>

<p>Again Bumpus sank down to the ground; although he was shivering with the
cold, he did not dare swing his arms around as before, lest it make him remember
how hungry he was.</p>

<p>Sitting there, he listened to the breeze sighing among the branches of the
pines; and to his excited mind it was actually laughing at the predicament of
the wretched chums.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>Something else
came stealing to his hearing, something that made Bumpus suddenly sit up, hold
his breath, and strain his senses trying to locate the direction from which it
seemed to spring, and at the same time guess the nature of the sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder now, was that a wildcat growling?&#8221; he asked
himself.</p>

<p>The thought was so disquieting, owing to the gathering gloom, that he could
not help reaching out his hand toward the heavy Marlin that he had temporarily
laid on the ground near by.</p>

<p>While the sound, whatever it may have been, was not repeated, so far as
Bumpus could tell, still he felt far from satisfied about it. What if the sly
old cat was at that very moment creeping up on them? For all they knew, it might
be close by just then, &#8220;inching&#8221; its way along, just as he had
watched a tame Tabby do at home, when trying to steal upon a sparrow it wanted
for its dinner.</p>

<p>Bumpus became quite nervous over the thought. He drew back the hammers of his
double-barrel, and began to look around him. All sorts of stories that he had
heard told from time to time about these bobtailed cats of the pine woods, with
their cousin, the lynx, that had tassels on its ears, now floated before his
mind. Naturally they did not tend to ease the strain under which he was
laboring; for where he had before only imagined he could see one pair of yellow
eyes staring at him from out the gloom, he now began to see them everywhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>Why, the woods
must be full of the creatures, and they were going to set upon the unfortunate
scouts, to make a meal for that cold night. And another thing gave Bumpus great
uneasiness; there was no use of trying to get away from this army of
&#8220;yellow-eyes&#8221; by climbing that hemlock; since cats were as much at
home in any kind of tree as on the ground.</p>

<p>No wonder Bumpus shivered now, with something more than the cold air. They
were certainly up against it, good and hard; and if ever they saw Thad and the
rest of the scouts again, how happy they should be.</p>

<p>Why didn&#8217;t Giraffe quit his fooling with that silly old bow, and take
to thinking up some scheme that was worth while? It seemed the height of
foolishness for him to be wasting all his time with that ridiculous fire-making
dodge, that never could be done anyway. Bumpus was almost tempted to stumble
forward, and pretend to fall over his kneeling figure, just to upset things, and
make Giraffe come to his proper senses. He would, only he was a little afraid
that the tall scout might be so furious that he would do something violent; for
he was getting &#8220;awful touchy&#8221; on the subject of making a fire in
that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only make dead sure of one of them yellow eyes, I&#8217;d
like to knock the beast over,&#8221; Bumpus was muttering to himself; and then
he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> rubbed his eyes
with his knuckles, as if trying to see better, after which he said
disconsolately: &#8220;It ain&#8217;t no use, they just keep dancin&#8217; all
around me. P&#8217;raps there ain&#8217;t any cats there at all. P&#8217;raps I&#8217;m just
imaginin&#8217; things, like my dad used to say I did, when they put me to bed
in the dark, tellin&#8217; me the angels was all around me, an&#8217;
wouldn&#8217;t let anything hurt me; but pretty soon, when the skeeters got
busy, I let out a whoop, and told &#8217;em the angels was bitin&#8217; me
something awful. P&#8217;raps if I shut my eyes I&#8217;d feel better.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when he started to try this, Bumpus found that it would not work. The
agony of not being able to see created new fancies in his mind, much more
dreadful than those that had gone before.</p>

<p>And so the anxious scout crouched there, not far from his industrious chum,
gripping his gun tightly in both hands, and breathing stertorously as he twisted
his fat neck around from side to side. He was trying to figure out a line of
action to be followed in case the worst came to pass; and be it said to his
credit that Bumpus was resolved to die game, as became a true scout.</p>

<p>At any rate, Giraffe could not keep up that silly business much longer.
Either he would just have to give over through complete exhaustion; or else his
&#8220;bally bow,&#8221; as Bumpus liked to call it, would break, as it had a
faculty for doing when the cord became weakened from constant friction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>Bumpus only
wished that time would hurry along, for he wanted Giraffe to forget about his
fad, and turn his attention to a more sensible way of getting fire. Now, there
must be a way of snapping an emptied shell into a little pile of tinder, and
catching the spark in some manner.</p>

<p>He tried to figure out how it could be done; but Bumpus never was very bright
with regard to details, for they confused him; so that he was soon floundering
about like a fish out of water; or a boy who did not know how to swim, when he
gets beyond his depth.</p>

<p>Why, it was real dark, and he could just barely make out the crouching figure
of Giraffe; but that everlasting humming sound still kept up, until Bumpus
thought it would set him crazy.</p>

<p>Now Bumpus started on a new tack. He tried to imagine the delight of his
companion if only he could suddenly remember having thrust a little box of
safety matches into his haversack before starting out; but he knew it was
useless to look, for he had certainly done nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, Bumpus was given an electric shock, when Giraffe let
out a shrill whoop; for with his mind so filled by visions of armies of wildcats
all ready to pounce upon them by and by, Bumpus was in a condition to be
startled.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his knees, and half raised his gun to his shoulder, under the
full belief that the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_192'></a>192</span> crisis so long dreaded was at last upon them, and
they would have to fight desperately for their very lives.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LITTLE FIRE BOW DOES ITS WORK AT LAST.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what is it, Giraffe?&#8221; exclaimed Bumpus, in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>told</i> you I c&#8217;d do it! On&#8217;y gimme time, and I&#8217;ll
figger the old thing out, I said; <i>and I have</i>!&#8221; cried the exultant
Giraffe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s burnin&#8217;!&#8221; gasped the other, staring at the
tiny flame that was playing hide-and-seek in the midst of the dry tinder that
had so long awaited its coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it is; anybody with one eye could see that!&#8221; Giraffe sent
back, about as happy a fellow as the sun ever shone on, because his long
endurance test had in the end met with such grand success. &#8220;Hey!
what&#8217;s the matter, Bumpus? Get a move on, and collect some stuff to add to
this, before the thing goes out on me. Lively, boy, lively with you, while I
shield it with my hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hugged the little blaze with his body and hands while Bumpus, dropping the
now useless <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span> gun,
eagerly gathered a lot of dry pine needles, and made a pile of them close to his
chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! glory! Bully for you, Giraffe! You&#8217;re the scout who can
stick to a thing like a plaster. Don&#8217;t it look good, though?&#8221; cried
the shorter lad; but the fire-maker would not let him loiter.</p>

<p>Presently there was no longer any dread of the fire burning out; and both of
the scouts could get busy collecting fuel. Dead branches were in demand, and
fortunately enough, there happened to be plenty of the same close by, so that
without much effort they were able to get quite a heap near the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s sit down, and warm up a bit,&#8221; suggested Bumpus;
although truth to tell, he was at that moment perspiring from his recent
exertions.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you want to talk about eating <i>now</i>, Bumpus, you&#8217;re
quite welcome,&#8221; the taller scout went on to say, with a grin;
&#8220;because there&#8217;s something to it. We&#8217;ve got the birds, and
we&#8217;ve got the fire to cook &#8217;em by. Who said I couldn&#8217;t start a
fire by sawin&#8217; at my fiddle till I burst a blood vessel? Wasn&#8217;t it
Davy Jones? Well, you c&#8217;n just tell him for me, next time you see him, Bumpus,
that he was all wrong. Why, it&#8217;s just as easy as fallin&#8217; off a log;
er, that is, after you know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we start in plucking the feathers off these birds,
Giraffe?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>&#8220;Might as
well, if we mean to eat &#8217;em; and speakin&#8217; for my own feelings I want
to say that a partridge&#8217;d go mighty well about now. Yum! yum! get busy
with one, and I&#8217;ll tackle the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys knew how to do the job of plucking the birds, and soon had the
feathers flying.</p>

<p>Both of them were feeling a thousand per cent better than before; and Bumpus
even hummed as he worked. Giraffe&#8217;s thoughts very naturally kept along the
line of his recent triumph. He had labored so long, and against such a handicap,
that he might well be excused for feeling proud of his success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good little bow!&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;you did the business, all
right, didn&#8217;t you? The trouble was, I didn&#8217;t just know how to handle
you; but I&#8217;ve got it down pat now, and I&#8217;ll never forget again,
never. Wonder what the boys&#8217;ll say when they hear about it? And Bumpus, it
came in right pat, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it did, Giraffe,&#8221; replied the other,
enthusiastically; &#8220;when we didn&#8217;t have a single match, night here,
cold as the dickens, wolves howling pretty soon, and no way of cooking these
plump partridges. Why, if you&#8217;d gone and arranged all the particulars, I
don&#8217;t believe you could a had it hit us at a better time. It&#8217;s just
great, that&#8217;s what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the cream is on you, Bumpus.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>&#8220;Shucks!
who cares for that? Why, a little while ago I&#8217;d given all the spending
money I expect to get as my share of the rewards for returnin&#8217; those lost
bank papers, for just one little penny box of matches. Why, I&#8217;ll be only
too happy to treat the whole crowd six times over, after this. There, my
bird&#8217;s done, Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here; and now how are we agoin&#8217; to cook &#8217;em?&#8221;
the other scout remarked.</p>

<p>Bumpus looked at him rather blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;we ain&#8217;t got a sign
of a frying-pan, have we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be a way of cooking &#8217;em by keeping the birds
close to the fire. All old hunters cook their game that way. And don&#8217;t you
remember, Bumpus, Thad and Step Hen took sticks, and stuck &#8217;em in the
ground, with chunks of venison on the other end. Step said it was just prime.
Well, what&#8217;s to hinder our trying that same old game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the partridges are too big and heavy; they won&#8217;t ever cook
through?&#8221; objected the fat scout, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; I guess now we can manage to slice the same in half,&#8221;
Giraffe continued, hopefully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done the job for my folks at
home, more&#8217;n a few times, when they wanted to broil a Spring chicken for
some sick person. We&#8217;ll have our game broiled, Bumpus, see?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>&#8220;Sure we
will; and while you&#8217;re about it, with that big-bladed knife of yours,
Giraffe, give mine a rip down the back, so I c&#8217;n split it open. It&#8217;s easy
to see you know how. Thad and Allan ain&#8217;t got so very much on you, when it
comes to doin&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this artful flattery did Bumpus manage to get his bird divided. He spread
it out carefully, and then started a hunt for the long sticks, by means of which
the bird was to be held in a proper position before the hot fire.</p>

<p>After considerable waste of energy, they finally managed, after a fashion, to
get the birds placed so that they received a fair portion of the heat that came
out of the fire. Several times the sticks either broke, or else failed to hold
properly, so that the game fell into the ashes, to be hastily rescued, and wiped
off before again being put over the fire.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged, and to the hungry scouts it seemed as though the two
partridges had tantalized them long enough. They gave forth an odor that was
positively appetizing; and finally Giraffe just could not stand it another
minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, they must be done by now,&#8221; he remarked, eying his bird
ravenously.</p>

<p>&#8220;They look pretty brown,&#8221; remarked Bumpus, &#8220;though that may
come from the scorching they got each time they dipped in the red-hot ashes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span> But I feel just
like you do, Giraffe; and if you say the word, it&#8217;s a go.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the tall scout started to savagely tear at one-half of his bird; and
not to be outdone the other boy copied his example. Perhaps at home they would
have complained long and loudly because the cook had sent food to the table only
half done; but then circumstances alter cases; and sitting there by their lonely
camp-fire under the pines and hemlocks, those two boys munched away, and nodded
toward each other in a suggestive way, that told how much they were enjoying
it.</p>

<p>What if the meat was far from being well cooked, did not those who knew say
that game should never be browned; and as for the gray ash that still clung to
the outside of each bird, why, the wood was sweet and clean that it came from;
and every fellow has to eat his peck of dirt sometime or other, they
understood.</p>

<p>And so they kept persistently at it until nothing but the bones remained of
the two partridges; and each boy was sighing because, like Alexander of old,
there were no more worlds to conquer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was just prime!&#8221; declared Bumpus; &#8220;and to think that
I shot the dandy birds too; so you owe your fine supper to me,
Giraffe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, eh?&#8221; chuckled the other. &#8220;How about the fire, tell
me that? How&#8217;d them same birds tasted raw? You wouldn&#8217;t have liked
&#8217;em as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span> much,
I reckon. So, you see, after all, Bumpus, honors are about even; you supplied
the game, and I fixed up the fire. Better call it a drawn battle, and end
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, just as you say; but the only trouble I can see is they
wasn&#8217;t near big enough to fit in with my capacity. There&#8217;s a vacuum
still under my belt; even if I don&#8217;t feel faint any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I guess we can hold out now till morning,&#8221; said Giraffe.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take our bearings again, and make another start for the
camp. And p&#8217;raps some of them might just be out looking for us right now; and
seeing this bright fire, they&#8217;ll head this way. So we&#8217;ll act like
we&#8217;re havin&#8217; the time of our lives; and don&#8217;t you ever go and
let on that we felt scared even a little bit, hear now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus, having a little pride of his own, readily promised. Besides, now that
they had partaken of a very good supper, and had that bright and cheery fire to
keep them company during the remainder of the cold night, things looked vastly
different; so that it was hard to believe he had ever shivered and groaned as he
contemplated their forlorn condition.</p>

<p>They sat there, talking about various things, for quite a little time. Once
or twice Bumpus fancied he heard some sort of sound in the woods that caused him
to send a quick glance toward where <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_199'></a>199</span> he had laid his &#8220;trusty Marlin&#8221; down;
but then, as Giraffe did not seem to pay any attention to the noise, he soon
forgot it.</p>

<p>But there came a time when both of them plainly heard a cough.</p>

<p>Giraffe grinned, and nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys are comin&#8217; all right,&#8221; he said, as if pleased;
&#8220;just like I said they&#8217;d be apt to do. Now, just sit where you are,
Bumpus, and make out to be as happy as a king. We&#8217;ll make &#8217;em
believe we&#8217;re quite at home at this sort of thing; and the only thing
we&#8217;re sorry for is that we can&#8217;t offer &#8217;em a nice hot bird
apiece. Look pleasant, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they caught what sounded like the low murmur of voices, and they
seemed to be approaching too. It did not occur to the two scouts that the
parties were coming from a direction opposite to the camp where their chums had
been left; partly because they had not the remotest idea where that same camp
lay.</p>

<p>Now they could hear the swishing of bushes, as though the newcomers were not
very particular about how they walked. Then it must be Step Hen or Davy Jones
who made all the noise, because they were greenhorns, and did not know how to
walk noiselessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n see &#8217;em comin&#8217;,&#8221; remarked Bumpus, who happened
to be sitting in a position that allowed of his using his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;Remember,
now, what I told you; just be feelin&#8217; as fine as silk, as if this camp
business was an old story with us,&#8221; and to further the deception Giraffe
started to stretch his arms, and yawn at a tremendous rate.</p>

<p>Bumpus did not answer; and thinking this a little strange the tall scout
turned his eyes that way. He discovered that Bumpus was staring as though his
eyes would almost pop out of his head. That, of course, made Giraffe twist his
long neck half way around, so that he might share in what had aroused his
companion to such a state of excitement.</p>

<p>And Giraffe also experienced a decided thrill when he saw two men come half
staggering into camp, who from their looks he knew must be Si Kedge and Ed
Harkness, the rough and lawless game poachers and bullies of the pine woods.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;BE PREPARED!&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>The two poachers were undoubtedly partly under the influence of liquor; for
the boys could see that they did not walk as straight as they should have done.
Besides, their eyes looked red, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_201'></a>201</span> there were other evidences of drunkeness, familiar
to Giraffe and Bumpus, who had often seen drunken men.</p>

<p>This made the situation the more critical, because in this condition men
often do things that they might hesitate to attempt if not under the influence
of strong drink.</p>

<p>They halted not far from the fire, and looked at the two scouts sitting
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;On&#8217;y two boys arter all, Si,&#8221; remarked the one they supposed was
Ed Harkness, as he swayed slightly to and fro, while coming to a halt. &#8220;I
guessed as haow yuh must a be&#8217;n mistook w&#8217;en yuh said it mout be ther hull
outfit. Les sit down, Si, an&#8217; make us tuh hum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fitting the action with his words he dropped on the ground, and held out a
pair of red and trembling hands to the fire. His companion still stood there,
glaring at the two boys, just as though they had done something to offend him.
Plainly Si Kedge was something of a pine wood&#8217;s bully; and he thought it
good policy to cow Giraffe and Bumpus right at the start, so as to take the
spirit out of them.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bumpus looked so white and frightened that it encouraged the man to
follow up his half-conceived idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, whaz yuh doin&#8217; here? Where&#8217;s the rest o&#8217; the
bunch? Know me? I&#8217;m Si Kedge, an&#8217; I&#8217;m <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span> a bad man to rile; so don&#8217;t get
gay now. Got anythin&#8217; to eat &#8217;raound here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus cast a quick, apprehensive glance toward his companion. His one
prevailing idea just then was that they ought to get up, and skip out as lively
as they could, leaving their nice fire for the two rough woodmen to enjoy. As
far as he could see, neither of the men seemed to possess any firearm; at least
they certainly did not carry guns, as might be expected.</p>

<p>But Bumpus saw something in the face of his chum that told him Giraffe was
not thinking of giving up that hard earned fire. He had worked too long to get
it, to desert the comfortable camp, just because two half drunken fellows
chanced to wander that way.</p>

<p>Bumpus saw more than that. Giraffe had his big old rifle across his knees. He
must have reached out his hand and secured it, while his chum was still staring
at the unpleasant couple who had invaded their camp.</p>

<p>That gave the fat boy an idea, following which he too reached for his gun,
though not making any show of it, for fear of arousing a storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been hunting, and got twisted in our bearings; so we
thought it best to go into camp,&#8221; Giraffe started to say, trying to keep
his voice from wabbling, as it seemed to be trying its best to do. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span> &#8220;And as for grub,
we haven&#8217;t got a single bite along with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They lies, Si!&#8221; burst out the second man; &#8220;&#8217;case I kin see
a heap o&#8217; bones clost ter whar they is settin&#8217;, like they&#8217;d
be&#8217;n eatin&#8217; some game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; replied Giraffe; &#8220;we knocked over a couple of
birds, but they wasn&#8217;t half enough to satisfy us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! got any licker?&#8221; went on Si, still eying the boys steadily
with that half threat in his bloodshot eyes, that Giraffe knew meant trouble,
sooner or later, so that he almost instinctively allowed his thumb to draw back
the hammer of his big bore rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never use it; and on that account don&#8217;t carry a drop along
with us,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess naow, ther foolin&#8217; yuh, Si!&#8221; broke in the fellow
who was sitting down. &#8220;And looky thar, d&#8217;ye see they gut guns?
Them&#8217;s w&#8217;at we needs ther wust kind, sense Cale Martin took ours away,
w&#8217;en he sez as haow we&#8217;re that drunk we&#8217;d git inter trouble with
&#8217;em. Bring me thet double-barrel. Allers did say as haow I&#8217;d like
tuh own a scattergun, tuh use on pa&#8217;tridge. D&#8217;ye hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus looked to Giraffe. He was unable to grapple with the situation
himself; but perfectly willing to do whatever his chum directed. Had the tall
boy told him to step over, and present the poacher with his nice new Marlin
ten-bore, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span> Bumpus
no doubt would have done it without a murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the hammers raised,&#8221; was what Giraffe said instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! are you agoin&#8217; to fight?&#8221; muttered Bumpus; but
obeying instantly.</p>

<p>The poacher who had made the demand made a move as though half tempted to get
up and enforce his words; but seemed to think better of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll step over, an&#8217; tackle yuh arter I got my hands warm,
see ef I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>Bumpus breathed again, for he had thought that the crisis was upon them. He
saw that Si Kedge had also stepped closer to the fire, and thrust out his hands,
as if not averse to taking some of the cold tingle out of them by the
application of warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we goin&#8217; to do, Giraffe?&#8221; whispered Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up for our rights, that&#8217;s what,&#8221; replied the other,
in about the same style of voice. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t going to chase me out
of this camp, not if I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re ugly, and mean to give us trouble,&#8221; urged the
alarmed Bumpus.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean they think they are,&#8221; returned Giraffe, grinding his
teeth, as if by that method he could infuse his soul with more of the fighting
spirit that was required to grapple with the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_205'></a>205</span> situation. &#8220;When they start to making a rough
house here somebody&#8217;s liable to get hurt. And as we hold guns, and they
ain&#8217;t got any, you c&#8217;n easy see who it&#8217;s apt to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Giraffe; tell me what to do, that&#8217;s all; because you
see, I&#8217;m that rattled I just can&#8217;t think for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep as cool as you can, Bumpus, and it&#8217;ll all come out right.
If we can&#8217;t handle a pair of fellers as unsteady as they are, it&#8217;ll
be some queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they keep right along comin&#8217; at us?&#8221; queried the
other, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then shoot!&#8221; replied Giraffe, savagely, between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right at &#8217;em?&#8221; gasped the shorter scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! aim at their legs, like I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; returned Giraffe.
&#8220;We&#8217;d hadn&#8217;t ought to do anything worse than that. But mark
me, Bumpus, when they see we mean business, they won&#8217;t dare come
far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giraffe was still very white, but his eyes shone with resolution. He had made
up his mind just how he ought to act under the circumstances; and being
exceedingly stubborn by nature it would require something little short of an
earthquake to make him change now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two men had been muttering between themselves on the other side
of the fire. What they were talking about the boys did not <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> know; but doubtless it must have had
something to do with the nice guns which they expected were so soon to fall into
their possession; for neither of them could imagine that these two city boys, as
they deemed the scouts, would dare defy them, once they ordered them to lay the
guns on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be ready!&#8221; whispered Giraffe again, and thus unconsciously
repeating the motto of the organization to which both of them belonged, for
preparedness is the cardinal virtue in every Boy Scout.</p>

<p>The two poachers had evidently managed to map out some scheme by means of
which they expected to overawe the lads, and secure everything they chanced to
have about them, which was worth taking.</p>

<p>Bumpus could see that they were about to get upon their feet, and this must
mean they intended to force conclusions. He shot one last look at Giraffe, to
imbibe some artificial courage, if such a thing were possible; and he saw that
while the thin face of his chum looked ghastly white, it at the same time showed
a pair of set jaws, and back of it gleaming eyes that told of a resolute spirit.
And somehow the very realization that Giraffe could be brave gave the fat scout
the consolation he sought.</p>

<p>He had followed out the injunction of the other, and both hammers of his
Marlin ducking gun were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_207'></a>207</span> drawn back, while his forefinger toyed with the
trigger of the right barrel.</p>

<p>Yes, the two men were about to start trouble, for already had the one they
knew to be Si Kedge gained his feet, as he seemed a little more spry than his
partner in wickedness.</p>

<p>Bumpus saw that he was starting to go around the fire in such a way that it
must be Giraffe who would have to look after him; while the second scoundrel, Ed
Harkness, fell to his lot.</p>

<p>He elevated his gun a little, so that he could throw it to his shoulder in
the wink of an eyelid, if necessary. Then he waited for the turn of events.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re acomin&#8217; &#8217;raound tuh see yuh, kids,&#8221; called out
Si Kedge, in a thick and meant to be threatening tone; &#8220;an&#8217; see tuh
it yuh don&#8217;t give us any trouble; er it&#8217;ll be the wuss fur ye. Stand
up, an&#8217; make us a present o&#8217; them fine traps yer holdin&#8217;. It
ain&#8217;t right thet boys shud be kerryin&#8217; guns, w&#8217;ile men goes without.
Go on, Ed; what yuh standin&#8217; back fur?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ed knew. He did not like the way that double-barreled gun was aiming in his
direction. The two boys had hastily climbed to their feet at the proper instant;
and both of them were now standing there, presenting their guns, but not in the
fashion Si had intended when he gave the order, for they were &#8220;muzzle to
the front.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>&#8220;Just
stand where you are, both of you!&#8221; said Giraffe, in a low but threatening
voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bead on you, Si Kedge, and if you want to see how
well I can shoot this big-bore gun, just take two more steps forward. Bumpus,
got that other coward covered, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, I have!&#8221; sang out the fat scout, trying to
appear as bold as if the whole thing might be only a little comedy that he was
enjoying immensely; when, to tell the honest truth, Bumpus could feel his fat
knees striking each other just like he had seen the telegraph operator pound the
key of his instrument; but if his gun wabbled, the fact was hardly apparent to
the man he was trying to keep covered.</p>

<p>It was certainly a fine tableau, that would often come back to the memories
of those two lads in future days. But while they seemed to be holding the fort,
so to speak, Giraffe knew only too well that they were up against two desperate
characters, and that if they slipped just one cog, it might have a different
ending than the one they wished to see.</p>

<p>What to do with the two men, now that they had thrown down the gage of
battle, and virtually made them prisoner, was a puzzle that Giraffe had to
solve. But his success thus far gave him courage to go at the new difficulty
with resolution. And Bumpus, content to bask in the glory of his <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span> chum&#8217;s more
aggressive nature, gave promise of proving himself a good scout, obedient to the
one in authority over him and capable of doing his little part in the game.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAPTURING THE GAME POACHERS.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yuh shoot, younker!&#8221; called out Si Kedge, when, on
advancing just one more step, he found himself confronted by the rifle held by
Giraffe, who had his cheek laid down on the stock, as though he were taking
aim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, if you do just what I tell you!&#8221; said the scout,
growing bolder when he saw that a sudden spasm of alarm had taken possession of
the poacher, as he realized the conditions confronting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wat yuh want us tuh do?&#8221; asked Si.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw up your hands, in the first place, and be quick about it!&#8221;
commanded the scout, thinking that was the proper thing to demand; because, in
every account he had ever read of such events, the one who held the gun always
gave that order.</p>

<p>Si Kedge did as he was told, but only after a vast amount of hard
language.</p>

<p>&#8220;You too!&#8221; Bumpus managed to call out; for <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span> since his comrade had shown the way, he
did not find it quite so difficult to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ther up, doan&#8217;t yuh see, ez far ez I kin git &#8217;em!&#8221;
complained Ed Harkness; and then seeing the fat boy elevating his gun, he made
out to duck, under the evident impression that Bumpus might be tempted to pull
trigger, and fill him full of bird shot. &#8220;Keep thet gun daown thar, kid; I
don&#8217;t like ther way yuh handles ther same. Yuh got us fur keeps; an&#8217;
we ain&#8217;t squealin&#8217;, is we, Si?&#8221;</p>

<p>Giraffe thought fast. If they allowed these two men to go free, the chances
were they would hang around, and try to give them all the trouble they could
during the night that was now well upon them. And the idea of letting them
remain there by the fire without being put under bonds, never occurred to the
boy. He knew neither of them could be trusted further than they could be seen;
that was stamped on their ugly faces, and the shifty look in their evil
eyes.</p>

<p>There was really only one thing to do, and that was to make them prisoners.
Once that had been accomplished, at least they might pass a peaceful night; and
then in the morning, if the humor seized them, it would be just as easy to let
the men go as to keep them.</p>

<p>But how on earth were they to tie the two men up? It looked like a hard
proposition, and Giraffe had to cudgel his brains with considerable gusto before
he was able to produce any result. But it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span> dawned upon him finally that if the men were
compelled to lie flat on their faces on the ground, and place their hands behind
them, Bumpus might straddle each in turn, and fasten their wrists, while he,
Giraffe threatened with the guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he said, with the air of a commander giving his
final orders on the field of battle; &#8220;Both of you have got to lie down on
your faces, and put your hands behind your back; do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be yuh agoin&#8217; tuh tie us up?&#8221; asked Si, his face as black
as a thundercloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that, and nothing more,&#8221; replied Giraffe, resolutely.
&#8220;You think that because we&#8217;re only two boys that we&#8217;ll stand
for a heap; but that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re away off your base. Get busy
now, and down on your marrowbones, both of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Air yuh agoin&#8217; tuh let us go free in the mornin&#8217;?&#8221;
asked Ed Harkness, already on his knees, for he wished to placate that uneasy
fat boy, who kept raising his gun again and again, as though anxious to press
the trigger just a little harder all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t give us any trouble, we might; because so far as
we&#8217;re concerned we&#8217;re not up here to help the game warden arrest you
fellows. Lie down now, or else we&#8217;ll have to help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a ferocious threat for Giraffe to make; and doubtless he would have
been exceedingly loth to put it into operation; but then the case was a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> desperate one, and
required a remedy of like nature.</p>

<p>Even such a fire-eater as Si Kedge &#8220;threw up the sponge,&#8221; as
Bumpus put it, and knuckled down to the half grown tyrant. Perhaps he realized
that in his half boozy condition he was in no shape to grapple with the dilemma
by which he and his companion found themselves faced. What with their hands tied
by the fact of their guns having been taken by Cale Martin, they were perfectly
helpless. And two firearms held in the hands of a couple of determined boys can
be just as dangerous as if grown men had them.</p>

<p>So, still uttering more or less protestations, coupled with hard language,
both Si and Ed sprawled out flat on their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bumpus, it&#8217;s going to be your job to secure them both,
while I cover you with the guns; and if either of them tries any funny business,
he&#8217;ll wish he hadn&#8217;t right speedy, believe me,&#8221; said Giraffe,
loud enough for the others to hear, for he wished them to wholly understand the
situation.</p>

<p>Bumpus placed his shotgun close to the feet of his chum. Then he looked
blankly around.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to say, Giraffe,&#8221; he remarked in a stage
whisper; &#8220;I&#8217;m willing enough to do it, tell you that; but where in
Sam Hill am I agoin&#8217; to get the rope? We didn&#8217;t bring any with us,
you know; though I&#8217;m resolved never to go off again without a whole
clothes line along. How c&#8217;n a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_213'></a>213</span> feller tie &#8217;em up when he ain&#8217;t got
even a top string with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>If Bumpus thought to get his chum in a corner with that question, he figured
too soon, for the other had discounted it already.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, take this,&#8221; he said, throwing his red bandana handkerchief
on the ground; &#8220;and I reckon you&#8217;ve got the mate to it in your
pocket. Use one to wrap around the wrists of each feller. And see to it that you
tie it in half a dozen of the hardest knots you know how. Understand,
Bumpus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, and I c&#8217;n do it too. You watch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the fat boy spoke he picked up the large bandana handkerchief, and stepped
gingerly forward, Giraffe accompanying him part way. Evidently Bumpus had
recovered somewhat from his fright. Possibly this new boldness sprang from
confidence in the ability of his comrade to handle the situation.</p>

<p>At any rate, he threw a leg over the prostrate figure of Ed Harkness, and
seizing both his wrists, jerked them together. The man might have raised some
protest, or even attempted to show resistance; but once that plump form of
Bumpus came down on him he had the breath partly pressed out of his body, and
must have experienced a sudden weakness.</p>

<p>At any rate, he lay still, while the other wound <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span> the crude rope around his wrists, and
knotted it good and hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; declared Giraffe, who had been watching the operation
with one eye, all the while he kept the other on Si Kedge; &#8220;now take your
own handkerchief, and use it on Si. And put in three extra knots, Bumpus,
because he&#8217;s that much more a slick one than the other feller. Lie still,
now, I warn you, Si; we ain&#8217;t going to stand for any fooling, I tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Si also relapsed into silence as soon as Bumpus dropped on his back; he was
pinned to the ground almost as effectually as though secured there by ropes.</p>

<p>Bumpus finished his part of the job, and arose, perspiring, but
triumphant.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s done, Giraffe, and as good as I know how,&#8221; he said,
exultantly. &#8220;I just warrant you that neither of them game stealers is
agoin&#8217; to break loose in a hurry now. What&#8217;s next on the little
programme? This is sure turning out to be a warm night for us, Giraffe. Tell me,
won&#8217;t the fellers stare when we walk into camp drivin&#8217; these jail
birds before us? Oh! my! Oh! me, I can see Davy and Step Hen give us the royal
salute. And I&#8217;ll whistle &#8216;Lo, the Conquering Heroes Come,&#8217; see if I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we ain&#8217;t in camp yet awhile,&#8221; retorted Giraffe;
&#8220;and give me a hand to assist old Si here over to that there tree. We c&#8217;n
lean him up against the trunk, so he can keep warm, and look around <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span> him. Then Ed, he might
have a place against this other pine, here. But Bumpus, there ain&#8217;t going
to be any sleep much for us this blessed night, with two toughs to watch like
these fellers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bumpus sighed, for he was very tired after a whole day&#8217;s tramp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not, Giraffe;&#8221; he remarked, but stiffening up to add;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll find me ready to back you up in anything you start
goin&#8217;. I&#8217;m game for it, I reckon; and if you see me agoin&#8217; to
sleep in spite of everything, why, Giraffe, just give me a kick or a punch in
the ribs. I want to do my duty every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, Bumpus; I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to make fun of you any
more, because of your size. Even fat fellers c&#8217;n come in mighty handy sometimes,
especially when you&#8217;ve got a game poacher to hold down.&#8221;</p>

<p>They managed to get the two men against the trees, and as they still had
their legs free this was not so difficult a task. Then the watch began. Giraffe
kept his gun close to his hand. He spoke to his chum occasionally, more to see
if Bumpus were awake, than because of any desire to engage in conversation.</p>

<p>The two men mumbled for a while, but finally their heads dropped on their
chest and they seemed to slumber, though Giraffe was suspicious, and would never
slacken in his watchfulness on this account.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind, however, that if <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_216'></a>216</span> Bumpus did fall asleep, he would not arouse him,
when there was no necessity for more than one guard at a time.</p>

<p>An hour passed thus. Then Bumpus, who was just losing himself, in spite of
his determination to remain on duty, felt his chum give him a shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m awake, all right, Giraffe; no need to scare me that
way!&#8221; grumbled the fat scout, stirring himself, and looking around.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming, just like I said,&#8221; said Giraffe.
&#8220;Looky over yonder, and you c&#8217;n see the lantern; and I reckon now,
it&#8217;s old Eli that&#8217;s followerin&#8217; our trail. But we don&#8217;t
want to be fooled a second time, Bumpus, so get your gun ready for
boarders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boarders!&#8221; muttered the fat boy; &#8220;now I like that, when
they ain&#8217;t a blessed bit of grub in the pantry. Better skip this
boarding-house, and go on further. But Giraffe, that sure <i>is</i> Eli; I c&#8217;n
tell the way he swings along from here. Whoever is it with him, d&#8217;ye
think; why, see, there are two of &#8217;em, and men, not boys of the Silver Fox
Patrol?&#8221;</p>

<p>Three minutes later, and Old Eli, grinning his pleasure, stalked into camp,
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! glad tuh find ye so well taken keer of, boys. An&#8217; so yeou
hed a wisit frum Si an&#8217; Ed, did yeou; an&#8217; wall, what d&#8217;ye
think o&#8217; thet, gents, here&#8217;s yer birds all triced up, ready tew be
transported to jail. This here is the game warden o&#8217; this deestrict, boys,
lookin&#8217; for them critters. Say as heow he don&#8217;t calkerlate ter
bother with Old Cale yet awhile; but hearin&#8217; as he&#8217;s be&#8217;n an&#8217;
contracted with a fox <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_217'></a>217</span> breedin&#8217; company, they&#8217;ll wait
an&#8217; see heow it pans eout. Kinder guess they will. An&#8217; we&#8217;ll
jest stay by this fire till mornin&#8217;, when we kin start back tew camp. Thad
knowed as heow yeou&#8217;d come out all right, Giraffe; but he thort along
abeout noon I&#8217;d better take up the trail; and I met these gents a few
miles back, wonderin&#8217; if ther birds had made this here fire, so we stalked
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bumpus felt like venting his delight in one long loud yell of
thanksgiving as he realized that their troubles were now at an end.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>TO BEARD THE TIGER IN HIS DEN.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Sure you can go, Jim; and what&#8217;s more, I&#8217;d like to take
the tramp with you, if it&#8217;s agreeable to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Hasty, the guide, swallowed something in his throat, when he heard Thad
say these words, for he was plainly much affected.</p>

<p>He had come in a hesitating way to ask as a favor that, since the scouts were
now settled for a few days in camp on the lake shore, could he be spared to make
the run through the pine forests to where the well remembered cabin of Old Cale
Martin stood, from which he had carried Little <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_218'></a>218</span> Lina away, after her father had positively refused
to even hear of their marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty kind o&#8217; yeou tew say thet, an&#8217; I feel
it, I swan,&#8221; he finally stammered, as he managed to thrust out his brown
hand, and take that of the boy which had been so impulsively offered to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; Thad went on, heartily, &#8220;you know, Jim, I&#8217;m as
much interested in this matter between you and Cale Martin as can be. And
I&#8217;m just bound to see you through. I heard what one of those men told you
about Cale going off to his cabin, so&#8217;s to try and keep away from
temptation, while Jim Hasty was around the neighborhood. He&#8217;d sworn to pin
your ears to a tree, and feared that he&#8217;d up and do it, if he had the
chance. Something better inside Old Cale was a tuggin&#8217; away at his hard
old heart; and Jim; you and I know what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The short guide nodded his head violently, while his eyes glittered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pore ole dad, he wants tew see his leetle gal ther wust kind,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s jest his consarned pride as keeps him frum knucklin&#8217;
right down, an&#8217; ownin&#8217; he war wrong. Thet&#8217;s what I sez in ther
fust place. I jest knowed he dassen&#8217;t raise a hand tew hurt me, as he
threatened, &#8217;cause Lina keers fur even ther leetle finger o&#8217; my hand;
an&#8217; she war ther apple o&#8217; his eye. An&#8217; shore I feels as
it&#8217;s agoin&#8217; tew be awl right, ef so be I kin on&#8217;y git a few words
wid ther ole man, face tew face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall, if I can help you out, Jim,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span> declared the boy, with emphasis.
&#8220;Perhaps some day, I might even see the Little Lina that all this fuss has
been about. I&#8217;d sure like to, the worst kind. But about when do you think
we&#8217;d better hike out across country for the Martin cabin, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like tew start inside o&#8217; an hour,&#8221; returned the
other, quickly, as his eye instinctively turned upwards toward the heavens, with
the idea of gauging what the weather might have in store for the State of Maine
during the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, you&#8217;re afraid of a heavy snowfall, that would make the
going and coming a hard job; is that it, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shore is, Thad,&#8221; replied the guide, promptly. &#8220;Yew see,
it&#8217;s long past due. The woods is as dry as tinder, and we need a big fall
o&#8217; snow er rain ther wust kind. D&#8217;ye think we mout git away by thet
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not,&#8221; answered the young scoutmaster
&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling in apple pie condition this morning, myself; and
you&#8217;re just wild to make the venture. So we&#8217;ll call it a go in an
hour, Jim. By that time breakfast will be done with, and the boys have their
plans arranged for the day. Eli will take charge with Allan; and there ought to
be no trouble. Both Bumpus and Giraffe are too tired after what they went
through with the day before yesterday, to want to wander; the game warden is
well on his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span> way
with his two prisoners; and everything looks just fixed to carry out your little
plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does thet,&#8221; returned the other, eagerly. &#8220;Seems like
things happened jest tew suit me. I calls it &#8216;Little Lina luck,&#8217; fur they
nigh allers turn thetaways when I&#8217;m tryin&#8217; tew please her. I worried
a heap over them tew critters, Si Kedge an&#8217; Ed Harkness; thinkin&#8217;
thet w&#8217;ile I mout convince dad, they was apt tew give me a lot o&#8217; trouble.
An&#8217; see haow they was kerried off tew jail tew clar ther field fur me! Oh!
sumpin&#8217; tells me hit&#8217;s goin&#8217; tew be awl rite yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything we ought to take along with us besides our guns, and
some grub, enough for several meals, because we won&#8217;t have any time for
hunting?&#8221; asked Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nawthin&#8217; as I knows on; I&#8217;m makin&#8217; sure to kerry
ther life preserver,&#8221; and as he said these mysterious words, Jim pressed
his hand against his breast, where in an inner pocket <i>something</i>
undoubtedly snuggled unseen; but somehow Thad never once dreamed that the guide
could refer to a pocket flask, because he happened to know Jim did not
drink.</p>

<p>However, Thad did not bother about trying to fathom Jim&#8217;s little
secret. He fancied that it would all be made plain shortly; certainly when they
happened upon the stern old man who was day after day cheating himself out of
happiness, by refusing to let bygones be bygones, and accept things as they
were.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>Of course the
balance of the Silver Fox Patrol showed great interest when they heard what was
the plan. Thad could read a trace of disappointment on more faces than one when
he announced that he meant to go alone with Jim. A larger detachment would do
more harm than good, since Old Cale might be angry at having his solitude
invaded by a party that Jim was piloting through the piney woods. And besides,
Allan was needed to take charge of the camp while the leader was away, Step Hen
had had his outing in the company of Thad, himself; Bumpus and Giraffe were
fairly saturated with adventure, and still feeling the effects of their
experience; while Davy was needed in camp, and complaining of a lame foot
besides.</p>

<p>So within the hour that had been set for the start, Thad and Jim left camp,
with many hearty wishes for their success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure and tell us all about it when you get back!&#8221; called
Bumpus; for some of the boys scented a little romance back of Jim&#8217;s queer
actions, and knew more or less about his relations with the giant father of his
little wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;And look sharp for forest fires, because, seems to me I smelled smoke
in the air a little while ago!&#8221; were the last words from Allan, who, being
a Maine boy, knew what such a thing meant.</p>

<p>Thad glanced sharply at Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you imagine we&#8217;ll stack up against anything like that,
Jim?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s hard tew say,&#8221; replied the guide. &#8220;At <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> this time o&#8217; year,
an&#8217; with ther woods as dry as they be, anything is possible, I&#8217;d
say. I don&#8217;t smell smoke right naow, but then ther wind mout a changed
sense Allan sez he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hardly know whether I want to run up against a real
woods&#8217; fire, or not,&#8221; Thad declared. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ve
always wanted to see what one looked like, because I&#8217;ve heard so much
about them; we&#8217;re on a new test now, for the Silver Fox Patrol; being
assistant fire wardens of the state of Maine; and as such none of us should wish
a fire to occur. So I&#8217;ll just forget all about it. If one happens to come
along, I guess there&#8217;s no harm in my looking at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim laughed at this quaint philosophy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I jest reckons naow, yeou&#8217;ll be doin&#8217; a heap more&#8217;n
jest lookin&#8217; at hit,&#8221; he took occasion to remark, with a sage shake
of his head.</p>

<p>Thad laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guess what you mean, Jim,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You think
that about that time the fire will take to chasing after me, and I&#8217;ll have
all I want to do in skipping out. Well, let&#8217;s forget all about that, now,
and talk of something else. For one thing, this is a splendid crisp fall
morning. I saw pretty good ice on the edge of the lake. And say, I&#8217;d like
to be up here a month or two from now. I warrant you there&#8217;s some mighty
fine skating on that sheet of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet they be, sumtimes,&#8221; replied the other, with a nod.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen hit jest as slick as a big pane o&#8217; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span> glass fur miles
an&#8217; miles. With ther wind ablowin&#8217; great guns I&#8217;ve jest opened
my coat, an&#8217; been blown like a thistle-down from one end tew t&#8217;other, in
less time than yew cud think. My dad, which is long gone, onct had an adventure
with a pack o&#8217; wolves on thet same smooth ice, I kin remember him
tellin&#8217; &#8217;bout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear it, Jim,&#8221; said the scout, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I&#8217;m a pore hand at tellin&#8217; a story,&#8221; the guide
admitted. &#8220;Seems like he war askatin&#8217; home, arter killin&#8217; a
deer, an&#8217; hed sum o&#8217; ther meat on his back, when ther wolves took
arter him. They chased him right fast, and ther on&#8217;y way dad he cud &#8217;scape ther
fangs war by making a sharp turn every time they gut too clost. Yer see ther
critters cudn&#8217;t swerve fast enuff, an&#8217;d slide a long ways on ther
ice &#8217;cause it war so smooth. An&#8217; in that way he kept goin&#8217; till he
gut nigh home; when sum o&#8217; ther neighbors, they kim out, an&#8217; knocked
spots outen ther wolves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! I can just imagine it,&#8221; declared Thad, &#8220;and I wager,
now, it must have been some exciting while it lasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chatting in this way they tramped on through the pine woods, heading in a
direct line for the distant cabin of Cale Martin, whose wife had long since been
dead, so that with Little Lina also gone, the old woodsman had lived alone for
more than a year, always nursing his grievance against Jim Hasty.</p>

<p>When noon came, and they stopped a little while <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span> to refresh themselves with some of the
food carried along in Thad&#8217;s haversack, Jim announced that they must be
more than half way to their destination.</p>

<p>Thad looked into the face of the guide frequently, wondering if Jim&#8217;s
heart was beginning to fail him the closer he drew to the implacable giant who
had uttered such ferocious threats against his new son-in-law; but the only
thing he did notice was a smile of supreme confidence whenever Jim happened to
put up his hand to touch the breast of his coat, about the place where an inner
pocket would be. And from this Thad understood that the other had the fullest
confidence that the message he was bearing to Lina&#8217;s father, the olive
branch he meant to extend to Old Cale, was sure to work as she had intended it
should.</p>

<p>It was about an hour and more, possibly two, after the noon halt, that Thad
saw Jim come to a stop, and start to sniff the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What it it, Jim?&#8221; he asked, though he could give a pretty good
guess even before the woods&#8217; pilot uttered a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I smells smoke, sure enuff, naow,&#8221; replied Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the wind&#8217;s changed, hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; inquired Thad,
bristling up, as a vision of more or less excitement to vary the monotony of
this rather dreary tramp through the piney forest flashed before his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure hes, Thad; and I kinder guess afore a great while yeou might
be havin&#8217; thet wish o&#8217; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_225'></a>225</span> yeourn kim true; &#8217;cause ther&#8217;s a fire sumwhar
not far away right naow; which, with ther change o&#8217; wind, is liable tew
sweep daown on us like a whirlwind. Mebbe so be yeou mout see more&#8217;n yeou
bargained fur, Thad!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAUGHT IN THE FOREST FIRE.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done about it, Jim?&#8221; demanded the
scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nawthin&#8217; as I kin see,&#8221; came the guide&#8217;s
philosophical reply. &#8220;We hain&#8217;t knowin&#8217; which way ther ole
wind&#8217;ll turn next, so it&#8217;s as safe fur us tew keep right along like
we was aheadin&#8217;, as tew turn back fur camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go on; an&#8217; perhaps after all, the fire&#8217;ll
give us the go-by,&#8221; and as he said this Thad put his best foot
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; Jim pursued, presently, &#8220;we cudn&#8217;t know
haow tew shape our plans till we cotched sight o&#8217; ther fire, an&#8217;
knowed jest what she be. By naow p&#8217;raps ther hull woods ahind us mout be aflame;
so by turnin&#8217; back, we&#8217;d jest be puttin&#8217; aour noses tew ther
grindstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on a little faster than before. The talk was of course all about
forest fires now, since it began to seem likely that Thad was about to witness
the first real big one of his experience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>Thad had a way
of asking leading questions, and Jim was no way averse to giving all the
information in his power; so that before long the Boy Scout had learned a great
many interesting facts connected with these terrors of the piney woods, by means
of which thousands of acres of valuable timber used to be wiped out of existence
every year, and often many lives lost as well.</p>

<p>Things are not the same as they used to be. The State of Maine has a well
equipped fire warden department; and during the fall season when the danger is
greatest, extreme care is taken to call out these seasoned fire-fighters
whenever their services are needed. Besides, every licensed guide is expected to
work in conjunction with the authorities in seeing that no party which he pilots
into the woods becomes reckless about leaving fires burning after breaking
camp.</p>

<p>When another half hour had passed Thad could no longer doubt that there was a
fire burning somewhere not far away, and that they were now much closer than
before to the scene of the conflagration.</p>

<p>The smoke had become a thing that could be easily seen as well as smelled,
and felt in the way of burning eyes and tickled nostrils.</p>

<p>Jim was on the alert. Well did he know that it was no child&#8217;s play,
matching one&#8217;s wits against a forest fire that was apt to encircle the
unwary woodsman, and cut off his retreat, finally roasting him in a trap.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8220;Do you
think it&#8217;s already swept down on the Martin cabin?&#8221; Thad asked,
somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet I kain&#8217;t tell,&#8221; replied Jim, as he looked up at the
smoke that was sweeping above the tops of the tallest pines. &#8220;Time was
when it wudn&#8217;t amattered any, &#8217;cause yer see, Dad Martin, he kept a good
clearin&#8217; all &#8217;raound his shack; but I guess as haow he&#8217;s been
an&#8217; neglected it sense I took Lina away, an&#8217; it&#8217;s all growed
up with brush, thet&#8217;d burn like tinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far away are we now from the cabin?&#8221; continued Thad,
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It mout be a matter o&#8217; two mile er so,&#8221; grunted Jim; for
they were pushing on at a lively pace, and there was not much breath to waste in
long sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;That smoke keeps on getting heavier all the while,&#8221; remarked
Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;She dew thet,&#8221; admitted Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my stars, how it stings a fellow&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; continued
the scoutmaster, who from time to time felt the tears running down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>Jim shook his head as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t a circumstance tew what we&#8217;ll run up aginst right
soon, ef things keeps on a gettin&#8217; wusser all ther while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! there goes a moose, upon my word; and he&#8217;s making tracks
as if he didn&#8217;t fear human beings one half as much as he did that
crackling fire he left behind!&#8221; Thad cried out, about five minutes
later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>Shortly
afterwards he discovered a huge lumbering animal rushing through the woods to
one side of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t that a black bear, Jim?&#8221; he asked, pointing as
he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; replied the guide, grinning; &#8220;an&#8217;
&#8217;baout as skeered a black as ye cud see in a week o&#8217; Sundays. Like as not
he smelled ther smoke while he was boxed up in sum holler tree, whar he &#8217;spected
tew stay till Spring kim along. But say, he knowed what&#8217;d happen tew him;
an&#8217; forgettin&#8217; as haow he orter be sleepin&#8217; ther winter aout,
alivin&#8217; on his fat, he jest climbs aout, an&#8217; scoots fur sum hole in
ther ground he knows is awaitin&#8217; fur him. He&#8217;ll git thar, awl rite,
too; &#8217;cause I never seed a bar cort in a forest fire, an&#8217; burned tew a
crisp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deer can easily escape, I suppose, being so fleet of foot?&#8221;
Thad went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gin&#8217;rally speakin&#8217; they kin,&#8221; Jim replied;
&#8220;an&#8217; thar goes wun rite naow. Look at ther way he jumps over thet
fallen tree like it was nawthin&#8217;. Ef yeou an&#8217; me hed ther gift
o&#8217; leapin&#8217; like thet, Thad, we cud larf at forest fires
tew.&#8221;</p>

<p>They lapsed into silence again. The smoke began to enter their lungs when
they talked too much, and half choked them. It was getting darker, Thad saw; and
looking up, he realized that clouds had covered the heavens; though at first he
rather fancied this might be another strata of smoke further up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>&#8220;Oh! if
that snow-storm Jim believes is due would only hurry, and come along,&#8221; he
was saying to himself, &#8220;it might do some good in putting out this fire.
While I&#8217;d like right well to see what it all looks like, still, as a fire
warden, I ought to want it to be smothered as quick as possible. And between the
two why, I&#8217;ll just have to take what comes, and be thankful it&#8217;s no
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he thought of the other scouts. Were any of them in danger from the
fire? He did not believe this could be the case, for, so far as he knew, there
had been no plan on foot for a hunt that day, the boys being satisfied to hang
around camp, and do things they had in mind.</p>

<p>And as they were right on the edge of the lake, if the worst came, and fire
happened to sweep down upon them, the tents could be thrown into the canoes, and
all hands put out upon the surface of the lake where they would be safe.</p>

<p>So Thad, as the one in charge of the patrol in the absence of Dr. Philander
Hobbs, the regular authorized scoutmaster, made up his mind that he need not
worry about his chums any more. Indeed, as the situation grew worse and worse
around himself and Jim, it began to look as though he had need of all his
anxiety in connection with his own condition.</p>

<p>Of course he relied entirely on Jim. The guide had had long experience with
the fires in the pines. He had served as one of the fire wardens, and so long as
he was in charge of the expedition there <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_230'></a>230</span> was no need of Thad trying to figure out any plan
of campaign. Had he been alone, or with some of his companions, Thad would have
striven to meet the necessities of the situation manfully, and done all in his
power to outwit the flames. Now he was in Jim&#8217;s charge, and depended on
the astute Maine guide to pilot him through.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hear the flames roaring, I think, Jim!&#8221; the scout
remarked, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s rite,&#8221; returned the other; and from his manner Thad
knew Jim had known of the circumstance longer than he dreamed possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;It lies over there on our right, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; Thad persisted
in asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; the guide answered, shortly.</p>

<p>Gauging the direction of the wind, Thad saw that they would in a measure be
running a race with the fire, to see which could get to the cabin of Old Cale
first. He knew Jim was figuring things out closely. A mistake in calculations
might cost them dear. Even a change in wind, which was liable to occur at any
time now, would bring them face to face with new difficulties, and make them
grapple with problems of a serious character.</p>

<p>Thad asked no more questions, for he saw that Jim did not want to have his
mind distracted from his duty. He would do the right thing, of that the boy felt
assured.</p>

<p>One thing was plain enough, and this seemed apt to have more or less bearing
on the final outcome of their race to the cabin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>The wind was
gradually increasing in force all the while. It had been gentle at first, but
was now blowing at the rate of ten miles an hour, and Thad could notice how
rapidly even this was changing.</p>

<p>Should it reach hurricane force ere long, the fire must be driven ahead at a
speed that would be simply frightful. Thad already began to experience some of
the thrill he had been told was connected with one of these woods&#8217; fires;
even though as yet he had to see the first flash of flame. What must it be when
surrounded on all sides by the leaping tongues that, they said, looked like
great red snakes coiling up the pine trees, licking the resinous foliage with
greedy breath, so that it seemed as though the whole world must be ablaze?</p>

<p>Well, the boy had wanted to look upon just such a sight, so that he could say
he had been caught in a forest fire; and from the way things were turning out,
his wish was in a fair way to be gratified.</p>

<p>They must surely have come about a mile since he last asked Jim how far away
the cabin might be; that would indicate half of the distance had been passed
over. He wondered why Jim did not start running, so as to beat the fire, that
was apparently aiming for the same place; but on second thought Thad believed he
could guess the reason for this. Jim was saving their wind for an emergency. If
that came upon them, they might have to change their own course, and head for
the pond Jim had spoken of as offering a fair haven of refuge in a case of this
kind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>The roaring
sound had grown more audible. It sounded now very much like a freight train on
the railroad, Thad thought; and drawing closer all the while! This would seem to
indicate that the fire was catching up with them, and shortening the gap between
at the same time.</p>

<p>Thad began to cast curious glances in the direction of the ominous sound; nor
could it be said that anxiety was not unmixed with his other feelings. He was
but a boy, after all; and even by now the dark masses of smoke that were
sweeping over the pine tops, as well as the other indications of a great
conflagration around him, had begun to affect Thad.</p>

<p>And as they pushed along it chanced that they came to a little break in the
wall of pines that rose around them. For the first time the Boy Scout saw, when
he turned his head toward the right, and the rear, something that seemed to leap
madly upwards, as though endeavoring to lick the overhanging clouds.</p>

<p>There was no need of Thad to ask the guide what that was, for he knew only
too well. Those leaping, tossing billows were flames; and they sealed the death
warrant of many a noble pine that for years and years had seen the lovely summer
come and go, to give place to the furious gales of the Maine winter season.</p>

<p>And Thad Brewster experienced a real genuine thrill, that might be tinged
with alarm, as he viewed this fiery panorama over the tops of the trees.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>TRUSTING TO THE WOODS&#8217; PILOT.</span></h2>

<p>It was by this time getting about as exciting as anything Thad had ever
dreamed of. The noise made by the sweeping flames began to din in his ears as he
had never expected to hear the roar of fire.</p>

<p>Still, he noticed that Jim had not changed his course much. Plainly then, he
was heading for the cabin of Cale Martin, and had not yet given up hopes of
being able to make it.</p>

<p>Only for the intense desire of the guide to please his Lina, doubtless he
would ere now have changed his flight, and headed for that pond, where they
could be certain of finding security. Thad only hoped Jim would not be tempted
to take too many chances, in his endeavor to accomplish the reconciliation.</p>

<p>So the boy began to strain his eyes, looking ahead, hoping that any minute
they would sight the lonely home of the late poacher, who had turned fox
farmer.</p>

<p>The fire could now be seen more plainly than ever, and Thad noted how the
wind seemed to carry <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_234'></a>234</span> all manner of whirling sparks far ahead, to set the
dead pine needles ablaze in turn; so that there was an ever marching procession,
as fresh patches of woods fell into the grip of the flames.</p>

<p>Something went squealing past them, almost upsetting Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, wasn&#8217;t that a pig?&#8221; he exclaimed, startled
by the sight.</p>

<p>Jim nodded his head, as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cale&#8217;s pig. Let&#8217;s &#8217;em hev ther run o&#8217; ther
woods sumtimes. But he&#8217;ll never see that porker agin. It&#8217;ll sure be
roasted ter a turn, I guess naow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What next, I wonder?&#8221; thought Thad, as he heard, rather than
saw, several frightened partridges go sweeping past.</p>

<p>All these things served to add a certain element of spice to the situation,
although Thad really believed it hardly needed anything to make it seem the most
exciting in all his experience.</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, Jim had certainly thought it wise to increase his speed
now, so that he was running fairly fast, considering the difficulties that lay
in the way of making good time.</p>

<p>When Thad came upon a broken-down rail fence, he knew they must be close in
the neighborhood of the cabin; and at the same time he thought that it was well
this was the case, because contact with the fire could not long have been
delayed.</p>

<p>A minute later, and he sighted the side of the cabin. As Jim had said, it
stood in comparatively open ground; but the brush had grown up again, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> owing to lack of care
when the owner lost interest in the home that no longer knew the presence of
Little Lina.</p>

<p>A couple of low sheds could also be seen near by; but even to Thad&#8217;s
uneducated eye it was plainly apparent that if the fire worked this way,
everything was bound to go. Cale Martin may have escaped by reason of his energy
before, on other occasions, but this would wind his place up.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any human being around. Jim seemed to look to the right
and to the left with more or less eagerness. Plainly he was disappointed because
he did not see the giant poacher somewhere. He hurried over to one of the low
sheds, and as Thad followed close after him, he saw that there was an enclosure
made of chicken wire, in which several red foxes were running furiously back and
forth, as though conscious of their peril, and wild to get out and escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;He cain&#8217;t be here!&#8221; Jim called out, for the fire was
really so noisy now that it required more or less of an effort to make
one&#8217;s self heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Thad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he&#8217;d never let them foxes stay in thar. Cale, he&#8217;s
human, ef he used ter be a hard case; an&#8217; knowin&#8217; ther fire&#8217;d
like as not git &#8217;em if they stayed cooped up, he&#8217;d sure broke the
wire fence daown so&#8217;s ter let &#8217;em run.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying which Jim deliberately did this himself, tearing up a stake, and in
almost the twinkling of an eye making a big hole, through which the four <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span> red foxes shot like
lightning. The last seen of them, the shrewd little animals were flying away
into the woods that as yet had not felt the scorching breath of the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they escape, Jim?&#8221; asked Thad, unable to repress his desire
for knowledge, even while facing such a scene of havoc as this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they will,&#8221; grunted the guide, who was already turning
hastily in the direction of the cabin.</p>

<p>The thought struck Thad just then that perhaps something had happened to the
big owner of the place. He might be found there, sick, and unable to move hand
or foot. In that case a new problem would have to be faced, and a solution
worked out.</p>

<p>But no matter what happened, they could not remain here long. The fire was
edging around, and working in toward Cale&#8217;s cabin. In ten minutes, perhaps
not so long a time as that, it would have swept over this territory, and gone
roaring and leaping into the woods beyond.</p>

<p>Now they were at the door of the cabin. It was shut, and there was no
evidence that Cale was within. Jim did not hesitate a second. He knew this was a
time for action rather than thinking; and so he immediately started to push open
the door.</p>

<p>Fortunately this did not seem to be fastened in any way, so the guide had no
trouble to speak of in doing what he desired.</p>

<p>Then Jim rushed inside, and Thad followed closely after him.</p>

<p>One glance around seemed to tell them that the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span> cabin was empty. It was a cheerless
looking place, according to the mind of the boy, accustomed as he was to the
comforts of a good home in a civilized community. But no doubt it had been
&#8220;home&#8221; to Cale Martin, up to the time the light of it was taken away
by young Jim Hasty.</p>

<p>The guide pointed to a small photograph that was fastened to the wall. It was
not a work of art by any means, and evidently represented the labor of some
aspiring village photographer; but as Thad bent hastily over to examine it, in a
couple of seconds, he saw that it was the face of a very sweet looking girl.</p>

<p>And he did not need to be told that he was looking on the face of Little
Lina, Jim&#8217;s wife, and the only child of the lonely poacher, Old Cale
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t here, Jim. What will we do now? Do you have any idea
where he&#8217;s gone?&#8221; the boy demanded, in his excitement clutching at
the sleeve of the guide&#8217;s coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kin give a guess, &#8217;baout it,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;Seems like
he keeps a litter o&#8217; foxes sumwhar off in ther woods; an&#8217; chances
air the ole man, he&#8217;s risked his life tew git out thar, an&#8217; set
&#8217;em free so&#8217;s they cud &#8217;scape. &#8217;Twud be jest like him tew dew thet
same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! I thought I heard a shout!&#8221; exclaimed Thad.</p>

<p>Both of them listened anxiously; Jim even hurrying toward the open door; but
before he could reach <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_238'></a>238</span> it, a huge form darkened the opening, and a man
came staggering in.</p>

<p>Thad knew that he was looking upon Cale Martin, long feared by every man in
the pine woods of Northern Maine. But to tell the truth he did not look very
formidable now; for his beard was singed, his face blackened, and his clothes
smouldering in patches, as though he might have been compelled to run the
gauntlet of fire in returning from his self-imposed errand of mercy in
connection with the impounded fox whelps.</p>

<p>He stared hard at them as though he could not just believe his senses. Thad
saw he was very nearly overcome with the smoke that had entered his lungs, as
well as the burns he must have received. And just then the boy realized
something of the real horror of a terrible forest fire. At a distance it might
seem a glorious spectacle; but close at hand its dreadful nature was
revealed.</p>

<p>Jim knew that this was neither the time nor place to waste a second in trying
to enter into explanations. Those could all keep until a more convenient season.
Cale Martin was all but played out. He swayed as he stood there, and Thad could
see that the wonderful strength that had many years before made him the marvel
of the lumbering camps, as Jim had told him, was very nearly utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p>And yet so great a hold had his dislike for Jim Hasty taken upon his nature,
that at sight of the man in his home he frowned blackly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We gotter mosey outen this right smart, Cale,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span> said Jim, boldly.
&#8220;Keep ther talkin&#8217; till we is safe from ther fire. Plenty o&#8217;
time then tew tell me what yew wants tew say. I kim hyar tew see yew &#8217;cause
Lina, she made me. Naow, let&#8217;s be headin&#8217; fur ther pond, &#8217;less we
wants tew be roasted an&#8217; stewed an&#8217; b&#8217;iled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant did not seem inclined to make the first move to save himself; and
it burst upon Thad&#8217;s mind that he was really in some sort of a daze.
Perhaps the heat of the fire had affected his head, and he could not gather his
wits. He may have headed straight back to the cabin, through the border of the
fire, simply because of that intuition which will carry a man, walking in his
sleep, past dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p>Jim must have guessed something of the same thing. That would account for his
daring to leap forward, and catch hold of Cale&#8217;s sleeve, though he had to
beat out a small conflagration at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me get him away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim did not say this, but his look did, as he turned toward Thad; and the boy
instantly sprang forward to take hold of Cale&#8217;s other arm. The giant,
strangely enough, did not seem to offer any objection. Perhaps he realized that
he was in a bad way, and that if left to his own devices must surely perish
there. And life may even have been sweet enough to accept it at the hands of the
man whom he believed had so terribly wronged him in stealing away his girl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>The instant they
stepped out of the cabin Thad was appalled at the change that had taken place.
Surely they could not have been inside for more than three minutes at the most;
and yet so rapidly had the smoke and fire headed in toward the cabin of Old Cale
that it was a fearful spectacle which burst upon their vision now.</p>

<p>The crackling of the flames, the crash of falling trees, the howl of the
wind,&#8211;all these made a combination that was deafening. Added to it was the
fierce glow of the fire itself, rising and falling as new patches of woods fell
into its never satisfied maw.</p>

<p>Thad began to wonder how it would all end, and whether that wish of his to
look on a real forest fire was not going to end in a tragedy. But he shut his
teeth hard together, and determined to play his part, as a true scout
should.</p>

<p>Jim was still there, and Jim would know what to do. The fire warden of the
past had learned many ways of outwitting the red-tongued enemy; and there was
hope of escape so long as he could remain on deck.</p>

<p>And so Thad drew in a long breath, half choked as he was, and waited to see
what course the woods&#8217; pilot would take.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>JIM DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Can we make the pond, Jim?&#8221; asked Thad.</p>

<p>He knew from what little the guide had said before, that it was a
considerable distance to the body of water to which Jim had intended heading;
and with the almost exhausted giant on their hands, it did not not seem likely
they could get there before being overtaken by the flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not ther big pond,&#8221; Jim called back; &#8220;it&#8217;s tew late
naow fur thet; but they&#8217;s a littler un &#8217;baout half way. Thet&#8217;ll hev
tew dew fur us, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cale seemed able to walk, after being thus supported, and they started off.
One thing Thad noticed; and this gave him more or less satisfaction. They were
heading now directly away from the fire, and not keeping alongside, as
before.</p>

<p>This gave them a new chance to escape, unless that change of wind came, which
was liable to occur at any moment.</p>

<p>Hardly had they been moving for a minute than <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span> Thad thought he felt something wet fall
on his nose. He could hardly believe it, but when a second and a third followed,
he became positive.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s raining, Jim!&#8221; he shouted, partly because of his new
excitement, and also on account of the racket the fire caused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet snow storm&#8217;s gut &#8217;raound et larst,&#8221; called back Jim;
and Thad knew from that the heat of the atmosphere had melted the flakes ere
they fell, causing them to turn back into water.</p>

<p>It was all the same though, since both were bitter enemies to fire; and
presently the merry war of the elements, that has gone on since the world began,
would be in full play.</p>

<p>He wished that it would come down as never before; indeed, it would need to
be a record fall, to extinguish those monster flames that were rising like a red
wall over the treetops now. But since the woods beyond would be undergoing a
gradual soaking, possibly the fire might find it more and more difficult to get
a foothold, and finally die out from lack of fuel.</p>

<p>Thad was astonished at the meekness of the giant. Why, he seemed to have lost
his grip on things, and let them carry him along just as though he were a big
baby. That would seem to indicate he must have been severely hurt while escaping
from <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span> the burning
forest. For aught they knew he may have been struck on the head by a falling
limb from a tree, which would account for his dazed condition.</p>

<p>At any rate, it was fortunate for the entire party that this proved to be so;
because any delay at this stage of the game must have proven fatal.</p>

<p>All of them were panting, but it was more from the intense heat than
weariness. Thad hoped the pond would show up soon. He was half choked with the
smoke, and coughed with nearly every breath. A drink of cool refreshing water,
he believed, would make him feel a thousand per cent better.</p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt about the anticipated change in the wind
having taken place; for the fire was certainly coming after them, full tilt.
Jim, too, was beginning to cast glances over his shoulder; and when a runner
does this Thad knew it was a good sign that he is anxious about something. It
may be the presence of a rival sprinter back of him; in this case that racer was
the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will we make it, Jim?&#8221; Thad found himself just forced to ask, in
order to relieve the terrible sensation of suspense that gripped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead sartin!&#8221; came the reassuring reply; &#8220;thar she be,
right naow!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>And looking
ahead Thad saw the sheen of a body of water in the dull glow of the forest fire.
It was not a large pond, but would offer them an asylum, where in all
possibility they might laugh at the efforts of the fire to get them.</p>

<p>When they gained the shore Jim kept pushing on until a point had been reached
that was opposite to the course over which they had just come. This threw the
water of the little pond between them and the source of danger.</p>

<p>Thad drew a long breath of relief as he realized that their race with the
flames was over, and safety assured. The giant sank down upon the ground, and
scooping up the water in the cup of his hand, drank savagely, showing that he
must be almost parched with thirst.</p>

<p>Feeling a little the same way himself, Thad followed suit; and never in all
his life had water tasted as refreshing as then. After that, he just stood and
watched the terrible panorama that was being gradually unfolded before his eyes;
listening to the roar of the devouring element as it seized whole rows of pines
in its grip, and enveloped them with a mantle of flames.</p>

<p>Thad was fairly awed by the sight. He had never dreamed it could be so
terrible, even when his imagination played at its liveliest clip. He saw the
leaping billows toss higher and higher; he watched them play tag with one
another; and all the while realized what havoc was being made with that splendid
forest. When the fire had passed on, or <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_245'></a>245</span> been finally extinguished by the downpour from
above, it would leave blackened and smouldering trunks where just a brief while
before the glorious pines stood in all their robes of green.</p>

<p>The heat was rather fierce, too, and often they would bend forward to lave
their faces in the cooling waters of the pond. Long since had the rim of ice
around the edge of the pool vanished, as though by magic; this was on account of
the warmth that had taken possession of the atmosphere while the conflagration
lasted.</p>

<p>But Thad was satisfied that they were going to escape, for the main body of
fire had already gone rushing away before the wind. Only straggling trailers
worked in behind the pond, and they were already feeling the effect of the rain
that was now falling heavily, though at other places it must have taken the form
of snow.</p>

<p>Jim was apparently more or less anxious about Cale. He feared the old man
might have received serious injuries that needed attention; and taking advantage
of the first opportunity that presented itself, he confided his fears to Thad,
knowing full well that the boy was something of a doctor, in his way.</p>

<p>So the scoutmaster sat down beside Cale. He saw that the other was getting
back to something like his normal self, now that he had in a measure recovered
from the exhaustion resulting from his fight for life with the flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get badly hurt anywhere, in the fire?&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span> Thad asked, trying to
put on a professional look, so as to inspire some confidence in the old man.</p>

<p>The giant for the first time, seemed to wake up. He felt of his head, and
winced a little as though it pained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ther burns they don&#8217;t amount ter much,&#8221; he said, in his
heavy voice; &#8220;but thar be a bad bump on my head as hurts sum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me look at it,&#8221; asked the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve picked up
some knowledge of medicine, and perhaps I can do something to make it seem
better; if nothing else, cold water may reduce the feverish feeling
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Cale allowed him to examine his big head, with its mass of hair that was
like a lion&#8217;s mane in thickness, having been protected from the fire by
the skin cap he wore. Perhaps it was the presence of that same cap, as also the
shock of hair, that had saved Cale from having a broken skull; he certainly did
have a lump there as large as an egg, that must have been very painful; and it
was no wonder he had seemed dazed at the time he rushed into his cabin, hardly
knowing why he came there, unless he had been laboring under the impression that
Little Lina was still waiting to be saved from the fire.</p>

<p>Fortunately Thad happened to be carrying a little bottle of witch hazel in
his haversack, which he often found exceedingly useful. This he got out, and
after warning the other that it might sting a little at first, he poured some of
the extract on the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
lump; and then wetting a piece of rag with it, he laid this over the wound,
Cale&#8217;s cap holding it in place.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I can do for you,&#8221; Thad said. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s not a serious thing, and in a few days you&#8217;ll be all over it.
But you must have had a fearful knock. Was it a limb that fell on
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what it war, younker,&#8221; replied Cale; &#8220;an&#8217;
it&#8217;s a feelin&#8217; better some, already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thad moved back. He seemed to know that Jim was just itching to have a few
words with his father-in-law; and that the opportunity seemed ripe. Besides,
Thad was more or less curious to know just what that clinching argument might
be, which Jim meant to advance, and which he seemed so positive would bring the
determined old man around.</p>

<p>When Jim took his place, Cale gave him one look, and then turned his head
away. &#8220;I wisht yew wudn&#8217;t feel like yew does agin me, Dad
Martin,&#8221; Jim started to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop right thar!&#8221; burst out the other, as his old temper began
to sway him again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything ter do wid yer, Jim Hasty.
Time was when I vowed ter pin yer ears ter a tree, if ever ye showed up hyar
agin; an&#8217; I meant it, I shore did. Then sumhow, thinkin&#8217; o&#8217;
that leetle gal, an&#8217; how she sot sum store by ye, kinder flabbergasted me,
an&#8217; I dassent stay around whar ye was, lest I do all I&#8217;d threatened,
an&#8217; it&#8217;d break her heart. So I kim hyar ter my lonely home, thet
ain&#8217;t hed a single ray o&#8217; sunshine in it sense ye stole her away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span> But I don&#8217;t
forgit it, Jim Hasty, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never agoin&#8217; ter forgive ye,
er make up. So don&#8217;t waste yer breath atryin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Thad saw the grin on Jim&#8217;s face he knew the guide felt
encouraged. His reception had been far less stormy than he had had reason to
expect from all he knew of the violent temper of his respected father-in-law.
And knowing that Jim was getting ready to spring his surprise, Thad almost held
his breath while listening and watching.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tole yeou I kim here &#8217;cause she sent me,&#8221; Jim went on, in a
pleading tone. &#8220;It grieved her gentle heart all this while &#8217;cause she
cudn&#8217;t see yeou, Dad Martin. She sez as haow it&#8217;s jest gut tew stop!
She wants yeou, and wants yeou bad. An&#8217; so be they&#8217;s another as ort
tew see yeou. Here&#8217;s ther message Little Lina sends tew yeou by me, her
husband. Sez she, &#8217;take this tew him, an&#8217; when he sees the face o&#8217;
my baby and knows thet we calls him Leetle Caleb, p&#8217;raps then he&#8217;ll
forgive yeou, Jim, fur takin&#8217; me away; an&#8217; come back tew us all.
Tell him we want him the wust kind, Leetle Caleb an&#8217;
Lina!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had thrust something into the hand of the old poacher as he spoke. Thad
felt almost like giving vent into his overwrought feelings in a yell. Why, all
the excitement attending the race with the forest fire had not been a
circumstance to the thrill that swept over him when he saw that hard-hearted old
man staring at the pictured faces of mother and child on that bit of cardboard,
and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span> then, filled
with a return of the old love, pressing it wildly to his bearded lips.</p>

<p>And Thad knew, just as Jim had said, that the message which Lina had sent in
the form of her baby&#8217;s picture, had broken down the barrier of the old
man&#8217;s pride and obstinacy; for in another moment he was squeezing
Jim&#8217;s hand convulsively.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;HOME, SWEET HOME!&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll go home with yer, Jim! I shore I&#8217;m sick fur a
sight o&#8217; my leetle gal. Lina&#8217;s baby too&#8211;I&#8217;d be ther
biggest fool in all Maine, not ter give in, arter yer kim up hyar, riskin&#8217;
yer ears ter tell me <i>thet</i>! We&#8217;ll jest try an&#8217; furgit
what&#8217;s gone by, Jim, an&#8217; start fresh. An&#8217; yer kin help me
raise my foxes fur ther company thet&#8217;s hired me fur five years ter run
ther farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was what Old Cale was saying as he pumped the hand of the delighted and
grinning Jim. And Thad was glad he was there to witness this joyous
reconciliation.</p>

<p>The fire had passed, and left them safe. Jim, when he could do so, made his
way back to the cabin; and on his return announced that it was only a blackened
ruin. Whereupon Old Cale sighed, and then seemed to look forward to a new home,
in which there would be an abundance of sunshine, because Little Lina, and
Caleb, the boy who was named after him, would reign there.</p>

<p>They managed to spend the night somehow, and in the morning started back to
the camp on the border of the lake; though after leaving the region <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span> where the fire had
swept, they found the snow quite deep, and the going bad. But apparently the
coming of the storm had extinguished the last lingering flames, so that the
saving to the state of Maine was beyond computation.</p>

<p>Arriving at the camp, Thad found the boys getting uneasy about him, and Eli
about to start out to see if he could get trace of the absent ones. They
understood that the distant fire, which had not come near them, must have been
in the neighborhood of Old Cale&#8217;s cabin, as described by Jim; and it was
this that made them worry. But it was all right now, and they received the
wanderers with hearty shouts.</p>

<p>The story, upon being told by Thad, evoked renewed cheering, especially for
the old poacher who had reformed, and was now going to show what he could do in
a line that appealed to him especially, since he knew all about the woods&#8217;
animals.</p>

<p>Just as Thad had said while Cale was feeling his burns, and the bump on his
head, he declared that nothing serious was the matter with him; and that even if
there had been, the glorious news that Jim had brought, at such risk to himself,
would have cured him effectually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Giraffe, as they gathered around the supper that
evening; &#8220;This is our last camp in Maine, seems like; for to-morrow Thad
says we start for the railroad station at Eagle Lake, through Lake Winthrop; and
soon we&#8217;ll be booming along for home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>&#8220;That
sounds good to me, fellers,&#8221; spoke up Bumpus. &#8220;Always did like my
home pretty well, and it never seems half so nice as when you&#8217;re away,
trying to make out you&#8217;re having a bunkum time sleeping on the hard
ground, with roots diggin&#8217; holes in your sides; and all sorts of creepers
crawlin&#8217; over your face. Home, sweet, sweet home for me, just
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just remember that you owe us all a treat, Bumpus,&#8221; spoke up
Davy Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we know Giraffe can make a fire that way now, because he showed
us yesterday, as easy as anything; but when I tried it, never a spark could I
get,&#8221; and Step Hen looked disgusted because of his lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! you needn&#8217;t feel bad,&#8221; declared Giraffe. &#8220;If it
took <i>me</i> all that time to get on to the proper wrinkle, and me a regular
fire fiend, how could you have the nerve to think you could hit her up the very
first thing? But Bumpus ain&#8217;t never going to question that I won that
wager, fair and square. Only because if I hadn&#8217;t, we&#8217;d a gone
without a supper that night, and been near frozen in the bargain. Lots of things
hinged on that fire, I&#8217;m telling you, fellers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say they did,&#8221; observed Bumpus, frankly. &#8220;Why,
on&#8217;y for its cheery twinkle them two poachers, Si and Ed, wouldn&#8217;t have
known we were around; and you see how we&#8217;d have missed doin&#8217; that
great stunt which will go down in the history of the Silver Fox Patrol as one of
the shining examples&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>&#8220;Oh! let
up on that stuff, Bumpus, and help me to some more stew,&#8221; Giraffe broke
in, as he passed his platter along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Allan, &#8220;we&#8217;ve had a pretty good time
of it up here, all told, counting the two separate trips we took. And
it&#8217;ll be a long time before we beat the record for big game we&#8217;ve
made in Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Allan did not know what was before the Silver Fox Patrol before many
moons had passed, or he would not have uttered this rash prediction. When the
summer holidays came along, they had another long journey in prospect, provided
the money was received from the bank, that had been offered for the restoration
of the securities carried off by the bold yeggmen captured by the scouts, and as
related in the preceding volume of this series. This trip would take them many
hundreds of miles from home, into a country toward which a number of the boys
had long looked with yearning eyes. And that Thad and his chums were fated to
meet with new and thrilling adventures that really exceeded any they had
encountered before, the reader will doubtless admit if he but secures the
succeeding volume to the present story, and which has been issued under the name
of &#8220;The Boy Scouts Through the Big Timber; or, The Search for the Lost
Tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is not a great deal more to add. Jim must have managed to send some
sort of message home, for at a certain station further down the road, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span> (after the boats had
been shipped through as freight, the two guides and Old Cale accompanying the
scouts on the regular train,) Jim said they would have to spend half an hour
there, and that they might as well get out to stretch. And lo and behold, there
came a girlish cry, and they saw a small figure flying straight toward Old Cale,
bearing a small bundle, which she immediately pressed into the clumsy arms of
the giant, who immediately wrapped mother and baby in a warm embrace.</p>

<p>Of course it was Little Lina, and Caleb Jr.; and the boys all had to be
introduced to Jim&#8217;s wife. They parted from them there; but upon arriving
home, one of the first things Thad and his chums did was to subscribe a round
sum apiece, and send up the nicest baby&#8217;s crib they could find in
Cranford; for somehow they felt a personal interest in Little Caleb.</p>

<p>Giraffe was feeling very proud those days. He had accomplished what looked
like the impossible when he finally managed to make his &#8220;silly fire
bow&#8221; work, and saved himself and Bumpus from going hungry and cold that
night they were adrift in the Maine pine woods.</p>

<p>Indeed, all of the boys had considerable to be proud of; and from that day
until school finally began, after the trustees had declared the quarantine
broken, each member of the Silver Fox Patrol was always the center of an
admiring crowd of listeners whenever he went abroad.</p>

<p>And the consequence was that a new patrol was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span> quickly organized, eight fellows
subscribing to the rules and regulations of the organization of Boy Scouts, and
being mustered in during the winter as the Eagle Patrol of the Cranford
Troop.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the best things that came out of our Maine
trip,&#8221; said Thad to his chum Allan, as they were on the way home from the
meeting when those eight new members had been sworn in, and promised to live up
to the rules laid down for the guidance of all scouts by the heads of the
organization.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;I was looking back the other
day, at the diary I kept while we were gone; and I find that a heap of things
came out of that same hunt up among the pines of Maine. All of us felt better
for the outing; more than one learned a lesson in perseverance that will follow
him all his life; we did a good thing in capturing those hobo thieves, Charley
Barnes and his crowd; then we made something of a record in hunting, you with
your first moose, and Bumpus with that honey thief of a black bear; after that
we helped wind up the poaching careers of Si Kedge and Ed Harkness; and last but
not least, had a hand in bringing about that splendid family reunion that we saw
on the platform, when we stepped off the train. On the whole, Thad, all of us
ought to be mighty well satisfied with the way things have gone. I know I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can say the same for me,&#8221; added the young scoutmaster.
&#8220;But after all is said, I think <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_256'></a>256</span> the most wonderful thing to happen was how Giraffe,
after missing fire a dozen times with his little bow and stick, should strike it
<i>just right</i> when it meant so much for him and Bumpus. And then Bumpus paid
for that treat like a little man, saying it was worth it, ten times over, just
to hear Giraffe <i>yell</i> when he&#8217;d succeeded in making his tinder flame
up without using a single match.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here we will leave the boys of the Silver Fox Patrol, to take up their
further adventures in the succeeding volume.</p>

<p class='c mt20'>THE END</p>
